# Learning alignments, an interesting perspective

## Learning pairwise alignment

### DEDAL

-   reference to transformer embedding

-   Predict substitution matrix

-   Reference other similar works

-   drawback: only on proteins

### predicting an alignment

-   Transformer models can also predict tokens -\> predict "CIGAR string" or a an aligned sequence.

-   Challenges:

    -   Longer sequences in DNA

    -   Size difference in the case of mapping

    -   Less information in a single nucleotide token than in proteins....

## What else could we learn ?

### Learn to predict seeds or starting positions

-   DeepMinimizer

-   predict start position given a pair of sequences

### Learn pre-processing functions

i.e. either connections in MSR graph or sequence 2 sequence models
