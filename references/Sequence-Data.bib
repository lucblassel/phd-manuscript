  abstract     = {Long-read technologies are overcoming early limitations in accuracy and throughput, broadening their application domains in genomics. Dedicated analysis tools that take into account the characteristics of long-read data are thus required, but the fast pace of development of such tools can be overwhelming. To assist in the design and analysis of long-read sequencing projects, we review the current landscape of available tools and present an online interactive database, long-read-tools.org, to facilitate their browsing. We further focus on the principles of error correction, base modification detection, and long-read transcriptomics analysis and highlight the challenges that remain.},

Using NGS an entire human genome can be sequenced within a single day.

Although in genome research NGS has mostly superseded conventional Sanger sequencing, it has not yet translated into routine clinical practice.

Conclusion 1928. Acknowledgements 1929. References 193The four best known DNA sequencing techniques are reviewed. Important practical issues  covered are read-length, speed, accuracy, throughput, cost, as well as the automation of  sample handling and preparation. The methods reviewed are: (i) the Sanger method and its  most important variants (enzymic methods); (ii) the Maxam \& Gilbert method and other  chemical methods; (iii) the PyrosequencingTM method – DNA sequencing in real time by the  detection of released pyrophosphate (PPi); and (iv) single molecule sequencing with  exonuclease (exonuclease digestion of a single molecule composed of a single strand of  fluorescently labelled deoxynucleotides). Each method is briefly described, the current  literature is covered, advantages, disadvantages, and the most suitable applications of each  method are discussed.},

  abstract     = {{$<$}p{$>$}Genetic sequencing technologies are evolving at a rapid pace with major implications for research and clinical practice. In this review, the authors provide an updated overview of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and emerging methodologies. NGS has tremendously improved sequencing output while being more time and cost-efficient in comparison to Sanger sequencing. The authors describe short-read sequencing approaches, such as sequencing by synthesis, ion semiconductor sequencing, and nanoball sequencing. Third-generation long-read sequencing now promises to overcome many of the limitations of short-read sequencing, such as the ability to reliably resolve repeat sequences and large genomic rearrangements. By combining complementary methods with massively parallel DNA sequencing, a greater insight into the biological context of disease mechanisms is now possible. Emerging methodologies, such as advances in nanopore technology, in situ nucleic acid sequencing, and microscopy-based sequencing, will continue the rapid evolution of this area. These new technologies hold many potential applications for hematological disorders, with the promise of precision and personalized medical care in the future.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which presses for the development of new alignment algorithms.Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of ≥100\,bp in length, ≥1\,kb genomic reads at error rate ∼15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3–4 times as fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is ≥30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.https://github.com/lh3/minimap2Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract     = {The wide implementation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has revolutionized the field of medical genetics. However, the short read lengths of currently used sequencing approaches pose a limitation for the identification of structural variants, sequencing repetitive regions, phasing of alleles and distinguishing highly homologous genomic regions. These limitations may significantly contribute to the diagnostic gap in patients with genetic disorders who have undergone standard NGS, like whole exome or even genome sequencing. Now, the emerging long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies may offer improvements in the characterization of genetic variation and regions that are difficult to assess with the prevailing NGS approaches. LRS has so far mainly been used to investigate genetic disorders with previously known or strongly suspected disease loci. While these targeted approaches already show the potential of LRS, it remains to be seen whether LRS technologies can soon enable true whole genome sequencing routinely. Ultimately, this could allow the de novo assembly of individual whole genomes used as a generic test for genetic disorders. In this article, we summarize the current LRS-based research on human genetic disorders and discuss the potential of these technologies to facilitate the next major advancements in medical genetics.},

  abstract     = {The major advance offered by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is the ability to produce, in some cases, in excess of one billion short reads per instrument run, which makes them useful for many biological applications.The variety of NGS features makes it likely that multiple platforms will coexist in the marketplace, with some having clear advantages for particular applications over others.The leading NGS platforms use clonally amplified templates, which are not affected by the arbitrary losses of genomic sequences that are inherent in bacterial cloning methods.An important advantage of single-molecule template platforms is that PCR is not required. PCR can create mutations that masquerade as sequence variants and amplification bias that underrepresents AT-rich and GC-rich regions in target sequences.There are four primary NGS chemistry methods: cyclic reversible termination, sequencing by ligation, pyrosequencing and real-time sequencing, which are described in this Review.To call sequence variants in genomes, NGS reads are aligned to a reference sequence using various bioinformatics mapping tools.Whole-genome sequencing using current NGS platforms is still expensive, but targeting regions of interest may provide an interim solution to analysing hundreds, if not thousands, of samples.To date, the sequences of twelve human genomes have been published using a number of NGS platforms, marking the beginning of personalized genomics.NGS costs will continue to drop in the foreseeable future, although the cost reduction should be weighed against the quality of the produced genome sequence.},

  abstract     = {Through four decades’ development, DNA sequencing has inched into the era of single-molecule sequencing (SMS), or the third-generation sequencing (TGS), as represented by two distinct technical approaches developed independently by Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Historically, each generation of sequencing technologies was marked by innovative technological achievements and novel applications. Long reads (LRs) are considered as the most advantageous feature of SMS shared by both PacBio and ONT to distinguish SMS from next-generation sequencing (NGS, or the second-generation sequencing) and Sanger sequencing (the first-generation sequencing). Long reads overcome the limitations of NGS and drastically improves the quality of genome assembly. Besides, ONT also contributes several unique features including ultra-long reads (ULRs) with read length above 300~kb and some close to 1 million bp, direct RNA sequencing and superior portability as made possible by pocket-sized MinION sequencer. Here, we review the history of DNA sequencing technologies and associated applications, with a special focus on the advantages as well as the limitations of ULR sequencing in genome assembly.},

With the ongoing developments of high throughput sequencing machines and advancement of modern bioinformatics tools at unprecedented pace, the target goal of sequencing individual genomes of living organism at a cost of \$1,000 each is seemed to be realistically feasible in the near future. In the relatively short time frame since 2005, the HT-NGS technologies are revolutionizing the human and animal genome researches by analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to DNA microarray (ChIP-chip) or sequencing (ChIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), whole genome genotyping, genome wide structural variation, de novo assembling and re-assembling of genome, mutation detection and carrier screening, detection of inherited disorders and complex human diseases, DNA library preparation, paired ends and genomic captures, sequencing of mitochondrial genome and personal genomics. In this review, we addressed the important features of HT-NGS like, first generation DNA sequencers, birth of HT-NGS, second generation HT-NGS platforms, third generation HT-NGS platforms: including single molecule Heliscope™, SMRT™ and RNAP sequencers, Nanopore, Archon Genomics X PRIZE foundation, comparison of second and third HT-NGS platforms, applications, advances and future perspectives of sequencing technologies on human and animal genome research.},

This chemistry has been utilized to synthesize several fluorescent derivatives of an oligonucleotide primer used in DNA sequence analysis by the dideoxy (enzymatic) method. The modified primers are highly fluorescent and retain their ability to specifically prime DNA synthesis. The use of these fluorescent primers in DNA sequence analysis will enable DNA sequence analysis to be automated.},

@article{vandijkThirdRevolutionSequencing2018,
  abstract     = {Forty years ago the advent of Sanger sequencing was revolutionary as it allowed complete genome sequences to be deciphered for the first time. A second revolution came when next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies appeared, which made genome sequencing much cheaper and faster. However, NGS methods have several drawbacks and pitfalls, most notably their short reads. Recently, third-generation/long-read methods appeared, which can produce genome assemblies of unprecedented quality. Moreover, these technologies can directly detect epigenetic modifications on native DNA and allow whole-transcript sequencing without the need for assembly. This marks the third revolution in sequencing technology. Here we review and compare the various long-read methods. We discuss their applications and their respective strengths and weaknesses and provide future perspectives.},
