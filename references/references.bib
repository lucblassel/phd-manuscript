  abstract     = {Purpose of review\~         The HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa is far from being under control and the ambitious UNAIDS targets are unlikely to be met by 2020 as declines in per-capita incidence being largely offset by demographic trends. There is an increasing number of proven and specific HIV prevention tools, but little consensus on how best to deploy them.         Recent findings\~         Traditionally, phylogenetics has been used in HIV research to reconstruct the history of the epidemic and date zoonotic infections, whereas more recent publications focus on HIV diversity and drug resistance. However, it is also the most powerful method of source attribution available for the study of HIV transmission. The PANGEA (Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized Epidemics in Africa) consortium has generated over 18 000 NGS HIV sequences from five countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Using phylogenetic methods, we will identify characteristics of individuals or groups, which are most likely to be at risk of infection or at risk of infecting others.         Summary\~         Combining phylogenetics, phylodynamics and epidemiology will allow PANGEA to highlight where prevention efforts should be focussed to reduce the HIV epidemic most effectively. To maximise the public health benefit of the data, PANGEA offers accreditation to external researchers, allowing them to access the data and join the consortium. We also welcome submissions of other HIV sequences from sub-Saharan Africa to the database.},

  abstract  = {In large scale applications as computational genome analysis, the space requirement of the suffix tree is a severe drawback. In this paper, we present a uniform framework that enables us to systematically replace every string processing algorithm that is based on a bottomup traversal of a suffix tree by a corresponding algorithm based on an enhanced suffix array (a suffix array enhanced with the lcp-table). In this framework, we will show how maximal, supermaximal, and tandem repeats, as well as maximal unique matches can be efficiently computed. Because enhanced suffix arrays require much less space than suffix trees, very large genomes can now be indexed and analyzed, a task which was not feasible before. Experimental results demonstrate that our programs require not only less space but also much less time than other programs developed for the same tasks.},

These have been reviewed and complemented with the most recent publications of interest.Results:Fixed-dose combinations are a significant advance in antiretroviral treatment simplification, contributing to an increase in compliance with complex chronic therapies, thus improving patients’ quality of life. Reducing the number of pills and daily doses is associated with higher adherence and better quality of life. As a fixed-dose combination tablet given once daily, EFV/FTC/TDF was the first available STR combining efficacy, tolerability and convenience, with the simplest dosing schedule and smallest numbers of pills of any ART combination therapy. The RPV/FTC/TDF is a next-generation NNRTI-based STR, a once daily complete ART regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Recently the combination of EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF was also approved by the European Commission, and is the first integrase inhibitor-based STR. Receiving antiretroviral therapy as once daily STR is associated with both clinical and economic benefits, which confirms previous research.Conclusions:The associated benefits of STRs provide a valid strategy for the treatment of HIV-infected patients.},

@article{alizonPhylogeneticApproachReveals2010,
  abstract     = {HIV virulence, i.e. the time of progression to AIDS, varies greatly among patients. As for other rapidly evolving pathogens of humans, it is difficult to know if this variance is controlled by the genotype of the host or that of the virus because the transmission chain is usually unknown. We apply the phylogenetic comparative approach (PCA) to estimate the heritability of a trait from one infection to the next, which indicates the control of the virus genotype over this trait. The idea is to use viral RNA sequences obtained from patients infected by HIV-1 subtype B to build a phylogeny, which approximately reflects the transmission chain. Heritability is measured statistically as the propensity for patients close in the phylogeny to exhibit similar infection trait values. The approach reveals that up to half of the variance in set-point viral load, a trait associated with virulence, can be heritable. Our estimate is significant and robust to noise in the phylogeny. We also check for the consistency of our approach by showing that a trait related to drug resistance is almost entirely heritable. Finally, we show the importance of taking into account the transmission chain when estimating correlations between infection traits. The fact that HIV virulence is, at least partially, heritable from one infection to the next has clinical and epidemiological implications. The difference between earlier studies and ours comes from the quality of our dataset and from the power of the PCA, which can be applied to large datasets and accounts for within-host evolution. The PCA opens new perspectives for approaches linking clinical data and evolutionary biology because it can be extended to study other traits or other infectious diseases.},

While progress has historically ebbed and flowed, the past two years saw dramatic advances driven by the increasing “neuralization” of structure prediction pipelines, whereby computations previously based on energy models and sampling procedures are replaced by neural networks. The extraction of physical contacts from the evolutionary record; the distillation of sequence–structure patterns from known structures; the incorporation of templates from homologs in the Protein Databank; and the refinement of coarsely predicted structures into finely resolved ones have all been reformulated using neural networks. Cumulatively, this transformation has resulted in algorithms that can now predict single protein domains with a median accuracy of 2.1\~Å, setting the stage for a foundational reconfiguration of the role of biomolecular modeling within the life sciences.},

Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

@article{altschulGapCostsMultiple1989,
  abstract     = {Standard methods for aligning pairs of biological sequences charge for the most common mutations, which are substitutions, deletions and insertions. Because a single mutation may insert or delete several nucleotides, gap costs that are not directly proportional to gap length are usually the most effective. How to extend such gap costs to alignments of three or more sequences is not immediately obvious, and a variety of approaches have been taken. This paper argues that, since gap and substitution costs together specify optimal alignments, they should be defined using a common rationale. Specifically, a new definition of gap costs for multiple alignments is proposed and compared with previous ones. Since the new definition links a multiple alignment's cost to that of its pairwise projections, it allows knowledge gained about two-sequence alignments to bear on the multiple alignment problem. Also, such linkage is a key element of recent algorithms that have rendered practical the simultaneous alignment of as many as six sequences.},

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSIBLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

@article{altschulOptimalSequenceAlignment1986,
  abstract     = {When comparing two biological sequences, it is often desirable for a gap to be assigned a cost not directly proportional to its length. If affine gap costs are employed, in other words if opening a gap costsv and each null in the gap costsu, the algorithm of Gotoh (1982,J. molec. Biol.162, 705) finds the minimum cost of aligning two sequences in orderMN steps. Gotoh's algorithm attempts to find only one from among possibly many optimal (minimum-cost) alignments, but does not always succeed. This paper provides an example for which this part of Gotoh's algorithm fails and describes an algorithm that finds all and only the optimal alignments. This modification of Gotoh's algorithm still requires orderMN steps. A more precise form of path graph than previously used is needed to represent accurately all optimal alignments for affine gap costs.},

@incollection{altschulSubstitutionMatrices2013,
  abstract   = {A substitution matrix is a collection of scores for aligning nucleotides or amino acids with one another. These scores generally represent the relative ease with which one nucleotide or amino acid may mutate into or substitute for another, and they are used to measure similarity in sequence alignments. Substitution matrices are used in conjunction with gap costs to construct local or global alignments. A local alignment substitution matrix implicitly corresponds to a set of target frequencies for aligned letters, which characterise the alignments the matrix may most easily distinguish from chance. Thus different substitution matrices are optimal for comparing related sequences that have diverged to differing degrees. The point accepted mutation and blocks substitution matrix (BLOSUM) series of matrices for protein sequence comparison have been derived from collections of related sequences. Special-purpose matrices may be appropriate for comparing sequences with biased nucleotide or amino acid composition. Key Concepts: Match/mismatch scores generally are suboptimal for comparing protein sequences. A log-odds substitution matrix is characterised by its target frequencies and scale. All local-alignment substitution matrices are implicitly log-odds matrices. Different substitution matrices are tailored to different degrees of evolutionary divergence. Amino acid substitution matrices are constructed from curated sets of alignments. The sequence divergence for which a substitution matrix is tailored may be measured by relative entropy. Special matrices may be preferred for comparing sequences with nonstandard nucleotide or amino acid composition. For gapped local alignments, statistical parameters must be estimated by random simulation. For protein-coding DNA, distant relationships are more easily detected at the protein than at the DNA level. For global alignments, an equivalent scoring system results from adding 2x to all substitution scores, and x to the score for each letter aligned with a null.},

Although there are several computational models for accurate drug response prediction, these often lack the ability to infer which feature combinations are the most predictive, particularly for high-dimensional molecular datasets. As increasing amounts of diverse genome-wide data sources are becoming available, there is a need to build new computational models that can effectively combine these data sources and identify maximally predictive feature combinations.We present a novel approach that leverages on systematic integration of data sources to identify response predictive features of multiple drugs. To solve the modeling task we implement a Bayesian linear regression method. To further improve the usefulness of the proposed model, we exploit the known human cancer kinome for identifying biologically relevant feature combinations. In case studies with a synthetic dataset and two publicly available cancer cell line datasets, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of our method compared to the widely used approaches in drug response analysis. As key examples, our model identifies meaningful combinations of features for the well known EGFR, ALK, PLK and PDGFR inhibitors.The source code of the method is available at https://github.com/suleimank/mvlr.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The capacity of HIV to develop drug resistance mutations is a major obstacle to long-term effective anti-HIV therapy. Incomplete suppression of viral replication with an initial drug regimen diminishes the clinical benefit to the patient and may promote the development of broader drug resistance that may cause subsequent treatment regimens to be ineffective. The increased clinical use of combination antiretroviral treatment for HIV-1 infection has led to the selection of viral strains resistant to multiple drugs, including strains resistant to all licensed nucleoside analog RT inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Therefore, it is important to understand the influence of such mutations on viral properties such as replicative fitness, fidelity, and mutation rates. Although research continues to improve our understanding of resistance, leading to refined treatment strategies and, in some cases, improved outcome, resistance to antiretroviral therapy remains a major cause of treatment failure among patients living with HIV-1.},

  abstract     = {The drug resistance of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is due to its fast and error-prone replication, is a key factor in the failure to combat the HIV epidemic. Performing pre-therapy drug resistance testing and administering appropriate drugs, or a combination of drugs, is therefore very useful. Genotyping tests HIV drug resistance by detecting specific mutations known to confer drug resistance. It is also cheaper than phenotypic testing and can be computerised, but it requires being able to know which mutations confer drug resistance. Previous research using pattern recognition techniques has been promising, but needs to be improved. It is also important that the techniques be highly adaptive when faced with new mutations or drugs. A relatively recent addition to pattern recognition techniques is the Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVMs have proved very successful in many benchmark applications such as face recognition and text recognition, and have also performed well in many computational biology problems. This paper explores the use of SVMs in predicting the drug resistance of an HIV strain extracted from a patient based on the genetic sequence of the viral DNA. We use as a case study that part of the HIV DNA that codes for the two enzymes, reverse transcriptase and protease, which are critical for the replication of the virus. To evaluate the performance of SVMs we used cross-validation to measure the unbiased estimate on 2045 data sets. The accuracy of classification and the area under the receiver operation characteristics (ROC) curve was used as a performance measure. We also developed other prediction models based on popular classification algorithms, namely neural networks, decision trees and logistic regression and these are explored in the paper. The results show that SVMs are a highly successful classifier and perform better than the other techniques with performance ranging between 94.1\% and 96.3\% accuracy and 81.3\% and 97.5\% area under the ROC curve.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new representation and feature extraction method for biological sequences. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. In the present paper, we focus on protein-vectors that can be utilized in a wide array of bioinformatics investigations such as family classification, protein visualization, structure prediction, disordered protein identification, and protein-protein interaction prediction. In this method, we adopt artificial neural network approaches and represent a protein sequence with a single dense n-dimensional vector. To evaluate this method, we apply it in classification of 324,018 protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein families, where an average family classification accuracy of 93\%±0.06\% is obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods. In addition, we use ProtVec representation to predict disordered proteins from structured proteins. Two databases of disordered sequences are used: the DisProt database as well as a database featuring the disordered regions of nucleoporins rich with phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-Nups). Using support vector machine classifiers, FG-Nup sequences are distinguished from structured protein sequences found in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a 99.8\% accuracy, and unstructured DisProt sequences are differentiated from structured DisProt sequences with 100.0\% accuracy. These results indicate that by only providing sequence data for various proteins into this model, accurate information about protein structure can be determined. Importantly, this model needs to be trained only once and can then be applied to extract a comprehensive set of information regarding proteins of interest. Moreover, this representation can be considered as pre-training for various applications of deep learning in bioinformatics.

  abstract     = {The recent development of third generation sequencing (TGS) generates much longer reads than second generation sequencing (SGS) and thus provides a chance to solve problems that are difficult to study through SGS alone. However, higher raw read error rates are an intrinsic drawback in most TGS technologies. Here we present a computational method, LSC, to perform error correction of TGS long reads (LR) by SGS short reads (SR). Aiming to reduce the error rate in homopolymer runs in the main TGS platform, the PacBio® RS, LSC applies a homopolymer compression (HC) transformation strategy to increase the sensitivity of SR-LR alignment without scarifying alignment accuracy. We applied LSC to 100,000 PacBio long reads from human brain cerebellum RNA-seq data and 64 million single-end 75 bp reads from human brain RNA-seq data. The results show LSC can correct PacBio long reads to reduce the error rate by more than 3 folds. The improved accuracy greatly benefits many downstream analyses, such as directional gene isoform detection in RNA-seq study. Compared with another hybrid correction tool, LSC can achieve over double the sensitivity and similar specificity.},

Study Design and Setting We conducted a study of all 10,674,945 residents of Ontario aged between 18 and 100 years in 2000. Residents were randomly assigned to equally sized derivation and validation cohorts and classified according to their astrological sign. Using the derivation cohort, we searched through 223 of the most common diagnoses for hospitalization until we identified two for which subjects born under one astrological sign had a significantly higher probability of hospitalization compared to subjects born under the remaining signs combined (P{$<$}0.05). Results We tested these 24 associations in the independent validation cohort. Residents born under Leo had a higher probability of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (P=0.0447), while Sagittarians had a higher probability of humerus fracture (P=0.0123) compared to all other signs combined. After adjusting the significance level to account for multiple comparisons, none of the identified associations remained significant in either the derivation or validation cohort. Conclusions Our analyses illustrate how the testing of multiple, non-prespecified hypotheses increases the likelihood of detecting implausible associations. Our findings have important implications for the analysis and interpretation of clinical studies.},

Because of the lack of a vaccine and antiviral drugs, the sole measure of control is limiting the Aedes mosquito vectors. DENV infection can be asymptomatic or a self-limited, acute febrile disease ranging in severity. The classical form of dengue fever (DF) is characterized by high fever, headache, stomach ache, rash, myalgia, and arthralgia. Severe dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are accompanied by thrombocytopenia, vascular leakage, and hypotension. DSS, which can be fatal, is characterized by systemic shock. Despite intensive research, the underlying mechanisms causing severe dengue is still not well understood partly due to the lack of appropriate animal models of infection and disease. However, even though it is clear that both viral and host factors play important roles in the course of infection, a fundamental knowledge gap still remains to be filled regarding host cell tropism, crucial host immune response mechanisms, and viral markers for virulence.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis is a promising approach for preventing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in heterosexual populations. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial of oral antiretroviral therapy for use as preexposure prophylaxis among HIV-1-serodiscordant heterosexual couples from Kenya and Uganda. The HIV-1-seronegative partner in each couple was randomly assigned to one of three study regimens--once-daily tenofovir (TDF), combination tenofovir-emtricitabine (TDF-FTC), or matching placebo--and followed monthly for up to 36 months. At enrollment, the HIV-1-seropositive partners were not eligible for antiretroviral therapy, according to national guidelines. All couples received standard HIV-1 treatment and prevention services. RESULTS: We enrolled 4758 couples, of whom 4747 were followed: 1584 randomly assigned to TDF, 1579 to TDF-FTC, and 1584 to placebo. For 62\% of the couples followed, the HIV-1-seronegative partner was male. Among HIV-1-seropositive participants, the median CD4 count was 495 cells per cubic millimeter (interquartile range, 375 to 662). A total of 82 HIV-1 infections occurred in seronegative participants during the study, 17 in the TDF group (incidence, 0.65 per 100 person-years), 13 in the TDF-FTC group (incidence, 0.50 per 100 person-years), and 52 in the placebo group (incidence, 1.99 per 100 person-years), indicating a relative reduction of 67\% in the incidence of HIV-1 with TDF (95\% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 81; P{$<$}0.001) and of 75\% with TDF-FTC (95\% CI, 55 to 87; P{$<$}0.001). Protective effects of TDF-FTC and TDF alone against HIV-1 were not significantly different (P=0.23), and both study medications significantly reduced the HIV-1 incidence among both men and women. The rate of serious adverse events was similar across the study groups. Eight participants receiving active treatment were found to have been infected with HIV-1 at baseline, and among these eight, antiretroviral resistance developed in two during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Oral TDF and TDF-FTC both protect against HIV-1 infection in heterosexual men and women.

  abstract      = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

The standard approach to consensus generation, pbccs, uses a hidden Markov model. We introduce DeepConsensus, which uses an alignment-based loss to train a gap-aware transformer–encoder for sequence correction. Compared to pbccs, DeepConsensus reduces read errors by 42\%. This increases the yield of PacBio HiFi reads at Q20 by 9\%, at Q30 by 27\% and at Q40 by 90\%. With two SMRT Cells of HG003, reads from DeepConsensus improve hifiasm assembly contiguity (NG50 4.9\\,megabases (Mb) to 17.2\\,Mb ), increase gene completeness (94\% to 97\%), reduce the false gene duplication rate (1.1\% to 0.5\%), improve assembly base accuracy (Q43 to Q45) and reduce variant-calling errors by 24\%. DeepConsensus models could be trained to the general problem of analyzing the alignment of other types of sequences, such as unique molecular identifiers or genome assemblies.},

@article{balabanTreeClusterClusteringBiological2019,
  abstract     = {Clustering homologous sequences based on their similarity is a problem that appears in many bioinformatics applications. The fact that sequences cluster is ultimately the result of their phylogenetic relationships. Despite this observation and the natural ways in which a tree can define clusters, most applications of sequence clustering do not use a phylogenetic tree and instead operate on pairwise sequence distances. Due to advances in large-scale phylogenetic inference, we argue that tree-based clustering is under-utilized. We define a family of optimization problems that, given an arbitrary tree, return the minimum number of clusters such that all clusters adhere to constraints on their heterogeneity. We study three specific constraints, limiting (1) the diameter of each cluster, (2) the sum of its branch lengths, or (3) chains of pairwise distances. These three problems can be solved in time that increases linearly with the size of the tree, and for two of the three criteria, the algorithms have been known in the theoretical computer scientist literature. We implement these algorithms in a tool called TreeCluster, which we test on three applications: OTU clustering for microbiome data, HIV transmission clustering, and divide-and-conquer multiple sequence alignment. We show that, by using tree-based distances, TreeCluster generates more internally consistent clusters than alternatives and improves the effectiveness of downstream applications.

This virus is a typical type-C RNA tumor virus, buds from the cell membrane, prefers magnesium for reverse transcriptase activity, and has an internal antigen (p25) similar to HTLV p24. Antibodies from serum of this patient react with proteins from viruses of the HTLV-I subgroup, but type-specific antisera to HTLV-I do not precipitate proteins of the new isolate. The virus from this patient has been transmitted into cord blood lymphocytes, and the virus produced by these cells is similar to the original isolate.

  abstract     = {Hepadnaviruses, including human hepatitis B virus (HBV), replicate through reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate, the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). Despite this kinship to retroviruses, there are fundamental differences beyond the fact that hepadnavirions contain DNA instead of RNA. Most peculiar is the initiation of reverse transcription: it occurs by protein-priming, is strictly committed to using an RNA hairpin on the pgRNA, ε, as template, and depends on cellular chaperones; moreover, proper replication can apparently occur only in the specialized environment of intact nucleocapsids. This complexity has hampered an in-depth mechanistic understanding. The recent successful reconstitution in the test tube of active replication initiation complexes from purified components, for duck HBV (DHBV), now allows for the analysis of the biochemistry of hepadnaviral replication at the molecular level. Here we review the current state of knowledge at all steps of the hepadnaviral genome replication cycle, with emphasis on new insights that turned up by the use of such cell-free systems. At this time, they can, unfortunately, not be complemented by three-dimensional structural information on the involved components. However, at least for the ε RNA element such information is emerging, raising expectations that combining biophysics with biochemistry and genetics will soon provide a powerful integrated approach for solving the many outstanding questions. The ultimate, though most challenging goal, will be to visualize the hepadnaviral reverse transcriptase in the act of synthesizing DNA, which will also have strong implications for drug development.},

  abstract     = {Drug resistance testing has been shown to be beneficial for clinical management of HIV type 1 infected patients. Whereas phenotypic assays directly measure drug resistance, the commonly used genotypic assays provide only indirect evidence of drug resistance, the major challenge being the interpretation of the sequence information. We analyzed the significance of sequence variations in the protease and reverse transcriptase genes for drug resistance and derived models that predict phenotypic resistance from genotypes. For 14 antiretroviral drugs, both genotypic and phenotypic resistance data from 471 clinical isolates were analyzed with a machine learning approach. Information profiles were obtained that quantify the statistical significance of each sequence position for drug resistance. For the different drugs, patterns of varying complexity were observed, including between one and nine sequence positions with substantial information content. Based on these information profiles, decision tree classifiers were generated to identify genotypic patterns characteristic of resistance or susceptibility to the different drugs. We obtained concise and easily interpretable models to predict drug resistance from sequence information. The prediction quality of the models was assessed in leave-one-out experiments in terms of the prediction error. We found prediction errors of 9.6–15.5\% for all drugs except for zalcitabine, didanosine, and stavudine, with prediction errors between 25.4\% and 32.0\%.

  abstract     = {Therapeutic success of anti-HIV therapies is limited by the development of drug resistant viruses. These genetic variants display complex mutational patterns in their pol gene, which codes for protease and reverse transcriptase, the molecular targets of current antiretroviral therapy. Genotypic resistance testing depends on the ability to interpret such sequence data, whereas phenotypic resistance testing directly measures relative in vitro susceptibility to a drug. From a set of 650 matched genotype–phenotype pairs we construct regression models for the prediction of phenotypic drug resistance from genotypes. Since the range of resistance factors varies considerably between different drugs, two scoring functions are derived from different sets of predicted phenotypes. Firstly, we compare predicted values to those of samples derived from 178 treatment-naive patients and report the relative deviance. Secondly, estimation of the probability density of 2000 predicted phenotypes gives rise to an intrinsic definition of a susceptible and a resistant subpopulation. Thus, for a predicted phenotype, we calculate the probability of membership in the resistant subpopulation. Both scores provide standardized measures of resistance that can be calculated from the genotype and are comparable between drugs. The geno2pheno system makes these genotype interpretations available via the Internet (http://www.genafor.org/).},

Motivated by recent advances in natural language processing that have demonstrated substantial gains on diverse tasks by pre-training on large unlabeled data, however, unsupervised pre-training on massive databases of protein sequences has proven to be an effective approach to extracting complex information about proteins. Such models have been shown to learn variant effects in coding regions in a zero-shot manner. In a similar vein, we here introduce GPN (Genomic Pre-trained Network) which can learn variant effects in non-coding DNA using unsupervised pre-training on genomic DNA sequence alone. Our model is also able to learn gene structure and DNA motifs without any supervision. We demonstrate the utility of GPN by showing that it outperforms supervised deep learning models such as DeepSEA trained on vast amounts of functional genomics data in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism for plant biology. Additionally, GPN trained on a single genome outperforms popular conservation scores such as phyloP and PhastCons, which are computed using aligned genomes from multiple species and can be used to predict the pathogenicity of variants that perturb highly conserved positions. We provide code (https://github.com/songlab-cal/gpn) to train GPN for any given species using its DNA sequence alone and learn corresponding zero-shot variant effects genome-wide.},

@article{benjaminiControllingFalseDiscovery1995,

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

@article{bennerEmpiricalStructuralModels1993,
  abstract     = {The exhaustive matching of the protein sequence database makes possible a broadly based study of insertions and deletions (indels) during divergent evolution. In this study, the probability of a gap in an alignment of a pair of homologous protein sequences was found to increase with the evolutionary distance measured in PAM units (number of accepted point mutations per 100 amino acid residues). A relationship between the average number of amino acid residues between indels and evolutionary distance suggests that a unit 30 to 40 amino acid residues in length remains, on average, undisrupted by indels during divergent evolution. Further, the probability of a gap was found to be inversely proportional to gap length raised to the 1·7 power. This empirical law fits closely over the entire range of gap lengths examined. Gap length distribution is largely independent of evolutionary distance. These results rule out the widely used linear gap penalty as a satisfactory formula for scoring gaps when constructing alignments. Further, the observed gap length distribution can be explained by a simple model of selective pressures governing the acceptance of indels during divergent evolution. Finally, this model provides theoretical support for using indels as part of "parsing algorithms", important in the de novo prediction of the folded structure of proteins form the sequence data.},

To accurately compare transmitted drug resistance rates across geographic regions and times, the World Health Organization has recommended the adoption of a consensus genotypic definition of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance. In January 2007, we outlined criteria for developing a list of mutations for drug-resistance surveillance and compiled a list of 80 RT and protease mutations meeting these criteria (surveillance drug resistance mutations; SDRMs). Since January 2007, several new drugs have been approved and several new drug-resistance mutations have been identified. In this paper, we follow the same procedures described previously to develop an updated list of SDRMs that are likely to be useful for ongoing and future studies of transmitted drug resistance. The updated SDRM list has 93 mutations including 34 NRTI-resistance mutations at 15 RT positions, 19 NNRTI-resistance mutations at 10 RT positions, and 40 PI-resistance mutations at 18 protease positions.},

  abstract     = {Summary  Language models have recently emerged as a powerful machine-learning approach for distilling information from massive protein sequence databases. From readily available sequence data alone, these models discover evolutionary, structural, and functional organization across protein space. Using language models, we can encode amino-acid sequences into distributed vector representations that capture their structural and functional properties, as well as evaluate the evolutionary fitness of sequence variants. We discuss recent advances in protein language modeling and their applications to downstream protein property prediction problems. We then consider how these models can be enriched with prior biological knowledge and introduce an approach for encoding protein structural knowledge into the learned representations. The knowledge distilled by these models allows us to improve downstream function prediction through transfer learning. Deep protein language models are revolutionizing protein biology. They suggest new ways to approach protein and therapeutic design. However, further developments are needed to encode strong biological priors into protein language models and to increase their accessibility to the broader community.},

  abstract  = {The established approach to unsupervised protein contact prediction estimates co-evolving positions using undirected graphical models. This approach trains a Potts model on a Multiple Sequence Alignment, then predicts that the edges with highest weight correspond to contacts in the 3D structure. On the other hand, increasingly large Transformers are being pretrained on protein sequence databases but have demonstrated mixed results for downstream tasks, including contact prediction. This has sparked discussion about the role of scale and attention-based models in unsupervised protein representation learning. We argue that attention is a principled model of protein interactions, grounded in real properties of protein family data. We introduce a simplified attention layer, factored attention, and show that it achieves comparable performance to Potts models, while sharing parameters both within and across families. Further, we extract contacts from the attention maps of a pretrained Transformer and show they perform competitively with the other two approaches. This provides evidence that large-scale pretraining can learn meaningful protein features when presented with unlabeled and unaligned data. We contrast factored attention with the Transformer to indicate that the Transformer leverages hierarchical signal in protein family databases not captured by our single-layer models. This raises the exciting possibility for the development of powerful structured models of protein family databases.1},

@article{blancoHIV1IntegraseInhibitor2011,
  abstract     = {With the approval in 2007 of the first integrase inhibitor (INI), raltegravir, clinicians became better able to suppress virus replication in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) who were harboring many of the most highly drug-resistant viruses. Raltegravir also provided clinicians with additional options for first-line therapy and for the simplification of regimens in patients with stable virological suppression. Two additional INIs in advanced clinical development—elvitegravir and S/GSK1349572—may prove equally versatile. However, the INIs have a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance in that 1 or 2 mutations are capable of causing marked reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir and elvitegravir, the most well-studied INIs. This perspective reviews the genetic mechanisms of INI resistance and their implications for initial INI therapy, the treatment of antiretroviral-experienced patients, and regimen simplification.},

@article{blasselUsingMachineLearning2021,
  abstract     = {Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) appear in HIV under treatment pressure. DRMs are commonly transmitted to naive patients. The standard approach to reveal new DRMs is to test for significant frequency differences of mutations between treated and naive patients. However, we then consider each mutation individually and cannot hope to study interactions between several mutations. Here, we aim to leverage the ever-growing quantity of high-quality sequence data and machine learning methods to study such interactions (i.e. epistasis), as well as try to find new DRMs. We trained classifiers to discriminate between Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (RTI)-experienced and RTI-naive samples on a large HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) sequence dataset from the UK (n ≈ 55, 000), using all observed mutations as binary representation features. To assess the robustness of our findings, our classifiers were evaluated on independent data sets, both from the UK and Africa. Important representation features for each classifier were then extracted as potential DRMs. To find novel DRMs, we repeated this process by removing either features or samples associated to known DRMs. When keeping all known resistance signal, we detected sufficiently prevalent known DRMs, thus validating the approach. When removing features corresponding to known DRMs, our classifiers retained some prediction accuracy, and six new mutations significantly associated with resistance were identified. These six mutations have a low genetic barrier, are correlated to known DRMs, and are spatially close to either the RT active site or the regulatory binding pocket. When removing both known DRM features and sequences containing at least one known DRM, our classifiers lose all prediction accuracy. These results likely indicate that all mutations directly conferring resistance have been found, and that our newly discovered DRMs are accessory or compensatory mutations. Moreover, apart from the accessory nature of the relationships we found, we did not find any significant signal of further, more subtle epistasis combining several mutations which individually do not seem to confer any resistance.},

  abstract   = {The retroelements are as diverse an assemblage of related molecular entities as can be found anywhere. With the exception of the retroviruses themselves, retroelements are genetic parasites that inhabit the genomes of all eukaryotes and many prokaryotes. The infectious retroviruses can be considered a highly evolved pinnacle on the complex phylogenetic tree that makes up the retroelements. The root of this tree is believed by many to be an ancient cellular reverse transcriptase gene, as originally proposed by Temin (1980), although this remains controversial. It is useful to consider the retroelements in comparison to the infectious retroviruses. The retroelement types, summarized in Table 1, include the endogenous retroviruses, the retrotransposons, the “retrotranscripts” (including the Alu-like sequences and the processed pseudogenes), and the prokaryotic retrons (also known as multicopy single-stranded DNAs [msDNAs]). Retroelements are known primarily as mobile DNA species integrated at various positions in the genomes of their host species, although most of them also have important extrachromosomal DNA forms. From the mitochondrial and chloroplast compartments of various organisms, the mobile group II introns (referred to here as retrointrons) and the retroplasmids are recognized as retroelements. Yet another major grouping of retroelements is the “pararetroviruses,” a group of true viruses with DNA genomes that, in a curious permutation of the retroviral life cycle, replicate via a cellular RNA intermediate but do not normally integrate into the host genome.},

@article{boermaHighLevelsPretreatment2016,
  abstract     = {Introduction Pre-treatment HIV drug resistance (PDR) is an increasing problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Children are an especially vulnerable population to develop PDR given that paediatric second-line treatment options are limited. Although monitoring of PDR is important, data on the paediatric prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa and its consequences for treatment outcomes are scarce. We designed a prospective paediatric cohort study to document the prevalence of PDR and its effect on subsequent treatment failure in Nigeria, the country with the second highest number of HIV-infected children in the world. Methods HIV-1-infected children ≤12 years, who had not been exposed to drugs for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), were enrolled between 2012 and 2013, and followed up for 24 months in Lagos, Nigeria. Pre-antiretroviral treatment (ART) population-based pol genotypic testing and six-monthly viral load (VL) testing were performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effect of PDR (World Health Organization (WHO) list for transmitted drug resistance) on subsequent treatment failure (two consecutive VL measurements {$>$}1000 cps/ml or death). Results Of the total 82 PMTCT-naïve children, 13 (15.9\%) had PDR. All 13 children harboured non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations, of whom seven also had nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance. After 24 months, 33\% had experienced treatment failure. Treatment failure was associated with PDR and a higher log VL before treatment initiation (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 7.53 (95\%CI 1.61–35.15) and 2.85 (95\%CI 1.04–7.78), respectively). Discussion PDR was present in one out of six Nigerian children. These high numbers corroborate with recent findings in other African countries. The presence of PDR was relevant as it was the strongest predictor of first-line treatment failure. Conclusions Our findings stress the importance of implementing fully active regimens in children living with HIV. This includes the implementation of protease inhibitor (PI)-based first-line ART, as is recommended by the WHO for all HIV-infected children {$<$}3 years of age. Overcoming practical barriers to implement PI-based regimens is essential to ensure optimal treatment for HIV-infected children in sub-Saharan Africa. In countries where individual VL or resistance testing is not possible, more attention should be given to paediatric PDR surveys.},

@article{boyerSelectiveExcisionAZTMP2001,
  abstract     = {Two distinct mechanisms can be envisioned for resistance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) to nucleoside analogs: one in which the mutations interfere with the ability of HIV-1 RT to incorporate the analog, and the other in which the mutations enhance the excision of the analog after it has been incorporated. It has been clear for some time that there are mutations that selectively interfere with the incorporation of nucleoside analogs; however, it has only recently been proposed that zidovudine (AZT) resistance can involve the excision of the nucleoside analog after it has been incorporated into viral DNA. Although this proposal resolves some important issues, it leaves some questions unanswered. In particular, how do the AZT resistance mutations enhance excision, and what mechanism(s) causes the excision reaction to be relatively specific for AZT? We have used both structural and biochemical data to develop a model. In this model, several of the mutations associated with AZT resistance act primarily to enhance the binding of ATP, which is the most likely pyrophosphate donor in the in vivo excision reaction. The AZT resistance mutations serve to increase the affinity of RT for ATP so that, at physiological ATP concentrations, excision is reasonably efficient. So far as we can determine, the specificity of the excision reaction for an AZT-terminated primer is not due to the mutations that confer resistance, but depends instead on the structure of the region around the HIV-1 RT polymerase active site and on its interactions with the azido group of AZT. Steric constraints involving the azido group cause the end of an AZT 5′-monophosphate-terminated primer to preferentially reside at the nucleotide binding site, which favors excision.},

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

@article{brentjensHumanPapillomavirusReview2002,
  abstract     = {Thimerosal has been widely used as a preservative in human vaccines for decades. Thimerosal, a thiol capping agent with ethyl mercury being the active degradant, could have impacts on the vaccine potency due to potential thiol modification. The effects on the antigenicity and immunogenicity of human papillomavirus (HPV) virus-like particles (VLPs) in the presence of thimerosal was studied. In general, reduced binding activity was observed between HPV antigens and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) upon thimerosal treatment, accompanied by reduced protein conformational stability. The immunogenicity of a pentavalent vaccine formulation (HPV6, HPV11, HPV16, HPV18 and hepatitis E virus) with or without thimerosal was studied in mice. The functional antibody titres, as well as the binding titres, were determined, showing a substantial decrease for vaccine formulations containing thimerosal for HPV16/18. Similarly, epitope-specific competition assays using specific and functional mAbs as tracers also showed a significant reduction in immunogenicity for HPV16/18 in the presence of thimerosal. Structural alterations in the capsid protein for HPV18 were observed with cryo-electron microscopy and 3-dimensional reconstruction in the comparative structural analysis. The results should alert scientists in formulation development field on the choice for vaccine preservatives, in particular for thiol-containing antigens. Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and it is estimated that Human papillomavirus (HPV) related cancers account for 5\% of all human cancers. Current HPV vaccines are extremely effective at preventing infection and neoplastic disease; however, they are prophylactic and do not clear established infections. Therapeutic vaccines which trigger cell-mediated immune responses for the treatment of established infections and malignancies are therefore required. The E6 and E7 early genes are ideal targets for vaccine therapy due to their role in disruption of the cell cycle and their constitutive expression in premalignant and malignant tissues. Several strategies have been investigated for the development of therapeutic vaccines, including live-vector, nucleic acid, peptide, protein-based and cell-based vaccines as well as combinatorial approaches, with several vaccine candidates progressing to clinical trials. With the current understanding of the HPV life cycle, molecular mechanisms of infection, carcinogenesis, tumour biology, the tumour microenvironment and immune response mechanisms, an approved HPV therapeutic vaccine seems to be a goal not far from being achieved. In this article, the status of therapeutic HPV vaccines in clinical trials are reviewed, and the potential for plant-based vaccine production platforms described. Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is a key factor in the development of precancerous lesions and invasive cervical cancer. Prophylactic vaccines to immunize against HPV are an effective approach to reducing HPV related disease burden. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity and dosage effect of a trivalent HPV 16/18/58 vaccine (3vHPV) produced in Escherichia coli (E.coli), with Gardasil quadrivalent vaccine (4vHPV, Merck \& Co.) as a positive control. Sera collected from rhesus macaques vaccinated with three dosage formulations of 3vHPV (termed low-, mid-, and high-dosage formulations, respectively), and the 4vHPV vaccine were analyzed by both Pseudovirus-Based Neutralization Assay (PBNA) and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Strong immune responses against HPV 16/18/58 were successfully elicited, and dosage-dependence was observed, with likely occurrence of immune interference between different L1-VLP antigens. HPV 16/18 specific neutralizing antibody (nAb) and total immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses in rhesus macaques receiving 3vHPV at the three dosages tested were generally non-inferior to those observed in rhesus macaques receiving 4vHPV throughout the study period. Particularly, HPV 18 nAb titers induced by the mid-dosage formulation that contained the same amounts of HPV 16/18 L1-VLPs as Gardasil 4vHPV were between 7.3 to 12.7-fold higher compared to the positive control arm from weeks 24–64. The durability of antibody responses specific to HPV 16/18 elicited by 3vHPV vaccines was also shown to be non-inferior to that associated with Gardasil 4vHPV. To detect human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, p21 oncogene, DNA content of urothelial cells in different bladder lesions with and without schistosomiasis and to correlate them with histopathological grade and stage. Eighty-five patients were enrolled: 25 chronic cystitis and 60 malignant bladder lesions; 15 schistosomal squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC), 45 urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma TCC) schistosomal and non-scistosomal. Ten healthy individuals served as controls. Genotyping of HPV 6/11 and 16/18 were done using in situ hybridization and p21 protein expression by Immunohistochemical technique in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. DNA content of urothelial cells were stained with felugen stains and measured using Automated Image analysis System. HPV DNA 6/11 and 16/18 expression was increased from cases of schistosomal cystitis with dysplasia to TCC with schistosomiasis compared to TCC and SQCC. The expression increased with statistical significance in invasive TCC and high-grade compared with superficial and low grade. Over-expression of p21 in invasive TCC group was compared with superficial TCC, high-grade TCC was compared low grade and TCC was compared with SQCC. Almost all cases of TCC associated with schistosomiasis exhibit aneuploid histogram compared to SQCC and all invasive TCC exhibited aneuploid histograms. Both HPV infection and p21 gene abnormalities may contribute to bilharzial bladder carcinogenesis. DNA image cytometric features may predict stage progression in TCC. Expression of p21, DNA HPV 6/11 and 16/18 may be used as biological markers of bladder carcinoma. The role of sleep in patients diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome is not fully understood. Studies of polysomnographic and quantitative sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) measures have provided contradictory results, with few consistent findings in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). For the most part, it appears that delta EEG activity may provide the best discrimination between patients and healthy controls. A closer examination of delta activity in the very slow end of the frequency band is still to be considered in assessing sleep in CFS. The present preliminary study compared absolute and relative spectral power in conventional EEG bands and ultra-slow delta (0.5–0.8 Hz) between 10 young female patients with the CFS and healthy controls without psychopathology. In absolute measures, the ultra-slow delta power was lower in CFS, about one-fifth that of the control group. Other frequency bands did not differ between groups. Relative ultra-slow delta power was lower in patients than in controls. CFS is associated with lower ultra-slow (0.5–0.8 Hz) delta power, underscoring the importance of looking beyond conventional EEG frequency bands. From a neurophysiological standpoint, lower ultra-slow wave power may indicate abnormalities in the oscillations in membrane potential or a failure in neural recruitment in those with CFS. Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN) is a significant complication after kidney transplantation, often leading to premature graft loss. In order to identify antiviral responses of the renal tubular epithelium, we studied activation of the viral DNA and the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensors Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) in allograft biopsy samples of patients with PVAN, and in human collecting duct cells in culture after stimulation by the dsRNA mimic polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), cytokines, or infection with BK virus. Double staining using immunofluorescence for BK virus and TLR3 showed strong signals in epithelial cells of distal cortical tubules and the collecting duct. In biopsies microdissected to isolate tubulointerstitial lesions, TLR3 but not RIG-I mRNA expression was found to be increased in PVAN. Collecting duct cells in culture expressed TLR3 intracellularly, and activation of TLR3 and RIG-I by poly(I:C) enhanced expression of cytokine, chemokine, and IFN-β mRNA. This inflammatory response could be specifically blocked by siRNA to TLR3. Finally, infection of the collecting duct cells with BK virus enhanced the expression of cytokines and chemokines. This led to an efficient antiviral immune response with TLR3 and RIG-I upregulation without activation of IL-1β or components of the inflammasome pathway. Thus, PVAN activation of innate immune defense mechanisms through TLR3 is involved in the antiviral and anti-inflammatory response leading to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), usually HPV types 6 and 11. The conventional method used for detection and typing the RRP isolates in our laboratory is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing method. A real-time PCR assay based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe technology was developed for the detection and rapid genotyping of HPV-6 and-11 isolates from biopsy material. The primers and probes were designed using multiple alignments of HPV-6 and HPV-11 partial E6 and E7 sequences that included prototypic and non-prototypic variants. Real-time PCR followed by probe-specific melting-curve analysis allowed differentiation of HPV-6 and HPV-11. HPV-6 and HPV-11 amplicons were used to determine detection limits and inter- and intra-assay variability. The detection limit of the assay was 12.8 DNA copies for HPV-6 and 22.5 DNA copies for HPV-11. A total of 60 isolates were genotyped using the FRET real-time PCR assay and a 100\% concordance was obtained when results were compared with genotyping based on conventional DNA sequencing. The real-time PCR assay based on FRET technology was able to detect and rapidly genotype HPV from tissue biopsy obtained from patients with RRP. The assay reduces the time required for genotyping from three working days to less than a day. Polyomaviruses are ubiquitous, species-specific viruses belonging to the family Papovaviridae. The two most commonly known human polyomaviruses, BK virus and JC virus were first described in the 1970s. Newer human polyomaviruses, namely KI polyoma virus, WU polyoma virus and Merkel cell polyoma virus were identified in the last five years. Most humans encounter BK and JC virus during childhood, causing mild illness. However, when reactivated or acquired in the immunocompromised host, BK and JC virus have been implicated in a number of human clinical disease states. BK is most commonly associated with renal involvement, such as ureteral stenosis, hemorrhagic cystitis and nephropathy. Less commonly, it is associated with pneumonitis, retinitis, liver disease and meningoencephalitis. JC virus is most well known for its association with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and is possibly implicated in the development of various human neoplasms. The following chapter will outline the basic virology, epidemiology and clinical manifestations of BK and JC virus and discuss relevant diagnostic and treatment options. Model systems show that papillomavirus DNA can persist after lesion-regression, and be maintained in a subset of epithelial basal cells. These are very likely long-lived ‘stem-cells’ or ‘stem-like cells’, with latency arising via at least two distinct mechanisms. The first involves low-titre virus infection and the retention of viral DNA at levels that are too low to allow life-cycle completion. The second involves lesion-formation, and clearance by the adaptive immune system, followed by persistence with low-level viral gene expression, and possible reactivation upon immune depletion. Mechanical irritation, inflammation and other extracellular influences affect viral copy number in the latently infected cell, and may predispose to lesion-reappearance. Reactivation may account for the recurrence of ‘apparently cleared’ cervical lesions caused by high-risk types, the appearance of Beta HPV-lesions following immunosuppression, and the development of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis in afflicted children.},

  abstract     = {Motivation: Read simulators combined with alignment evaluation tools provide the most straightforward way to evaluate and compare mappers. Simulation of reads is accompanied by information about their positions in the source genome. This information is then used to evaluate alignments produced by the mapper. Finally, reports containing statistics of successful read alignments are created. In default of standards for encoding read origins, every evaluation tool has to be made explicitly compatible with the simulator used to generate reads.Results: To solve this obstacle, we have created a generic format Read Naming Format (R nf ) for assigning read names with encoded information about original positions. Futhermore, we have developed an associated software package R nf Tools containing two principal components. MIS hmash applies one of popular read simulating tools (among D wg S im , A rt , M ason , C u R e S im , etc.) and transforms the generated reads into R nf format. LAVE nder evaluates then a given read mapper using simulated reads in R nf format. A special attention is payed to mapping qualities that serve for parametrization of R oc curves, and to evaluation of the effect of read sample contamination.

In previous studies, the antisense transcript has been identified both in various HIV-infected cell lines and in leukocytes of HIV-1+ patients. The expression of the corresponding antisense protein (ASP) during natural HIV-1 infection has been indirectly evidenced by the identification of anti-ASP antibodies in the sera of HIV+ patients. We have used immunoelectron microscopy procedures (ultrasmall gold particles coupled to silver enhancement) to establish direct evidence of ASP production. ASP has then been detected in chronically and acutely HIV-1-infected cell lines. The protein, found mostly associated with various cellular membranes as well as with the virions released from the cells, indicated that ASP is a bona fide component for the virions and may participate in the particle formation.},

In practice, generalizability is frequently estimated by averaging the accuracies obtained on individual cross-validation folds. This procedure, however, is problematic in two ways. First, it does not allow for the derivation of meaningful confidence intervals. Second, it leads to an optimistic estimate when a biased classifier is tested on an imbalanced dataset. We show that both problems can be overcome by replacing the conventional point estimate of accuracy by an estimate of the posterior distribution of the balanced accuracy.},

@article{brouwerFeedforwardNetworkInput2002,
  abstract     = {The data on which a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is to be trained to approximate a continuous function may have inputs that are categorical rather than numeric or quantitative such as color, gender, race, etc. A categorical variable causes a discontinuous relationship between an input variable and the output. A MLP, with connection matrices that multiply input values and sigmoid functions that further transform values, represents a continuous mapping in all input variables. A MLP therefore requires that all inputs correspond to numeric, continuously valued variables and represents a continuous function in all input variables. The way that this problem is usually dealt with is to replace the categorical values by numeric ones and treat them as if they were continuously valued. However, there is no meaningful correspondence between the continuous quantities generated this way and the original categorical values. Another approach is to encode the categorical portion of the input using 1-out-of-n encoding and include this code as input to the MLP. The approach in this paper is to segregate categorical variables from the continuous independent variables completely. The MLP is trained with multiple outputs; a separate output unit for each of the allowed combination of values of the categorical independent variables. During training the categorical value or combination of categorical values determines which of the output units should have the target value on it, with the remaining outputs being ‘do not care’. Three data sets were used for comparison of methods. Results show that this approach is much more effective than the conventional approach of assigning continuous variables to the categorical features. In case of the data set where there were several categorical variables the method proposed here is also more effective than the 1-out-of-n input method.},

We examined the effect of each of these factors on familywise and false negative error rates and compared the false negative error rates of methods with an acceptable familywise error. Only four methods were not bettered in this comparison. Unfortunately, however, a uniformly best method of those examined does not exist. A suggested strategy for examining corrections uses a succession of methods that are increasingly lax in familywise error.

In one study, HIV from 16\% of such antiretroviral-naive individuals was shown to have a susceptibility to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NNRTIs) between 2.5- and 10-fold lower than that of a wild-type control. Mutations in the RT domain that had previously been associated with antiretroviral resistance were not shared by these strains. We have analyzed by logistic regression 46 variable amino acid sites in RT for their effect on susceptibility and have identified two novel sites influencing susceptibility to NNRTIs: amino acids 135 and 283 in RT. Eight different combinations of amino acids at these sites were observed among these patients. These combinations showed a 14-fold range in mean susceptibility to both nevirapine and delavirdine. In vitro mutagenesis of the control strain combined with a phenotypic assay confirmed the significance of amino acid variation at these sites for susceptibility to NNRTIs.},

Available implementations, however, are usually optimized for a particular task and difficult to reuse. To enable researchers to utilize these networks more easily, we implemented pysster, a Python package for training CNNs on biological sequence data. Sequences are classified by learning sequence and structure motifs and the package offers an automated hyper-parameter optimization procedure and options to visualize learned motifs along with information about their positional and class enrichment. The package runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU and provides a simple interface to train and evaluate a network with a handful lines of code. Using an RNA A-to-I editing dataset and cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-seq binding site sequences, we demonstrate that pysster classifies sequences with higher accuracy than previous methods, such as GraphProt or ssHMM, and is able to recover known sequence and structure motifs.pysster is freely available at https://github.com/budach/pysster.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract  = {Endogenous or surrogate ligands of a vast number of proteins remain unknown. Identification of small molecules that bind to these orphan proteins will not only shed new light into their biological functions but also provide new opportunities for drug discovery. Deep learning plays an increasing role in the prediction of chemical-protein interactions, but it faces several challenges in protein deorphanization. Bioassay data are highly biased to certain proteins, making it difficult to train a generalizable machine learning model for the proteins that are dissimilar from the ones in the training data set. Pre-training offers a general solution to improving the model generalization, but needs incorporation of domain knowledge and customization of task-specific supervised learning. To address these challenges, we develop a novel protein pre-training method, DIstilled Sequence Alignment Embedding (DISAE), and a module-based fine-tuning strategy for the protein deorphanization. In the benchmark studies, DISAE significantly improves the generalizability and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with a large margin. The interpretability analysis of pre-trained model suggests that it learns biologically meaningful information. We further use DISAE to assign ligands to 649 human orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) and to cluster the human GPCRome by integrating their phylogenetic and ligand relationships. The promising results of DISAE open an avenue for exploring the chemical landscape of entire sequenced genomes.},

@article{campillo-balderasViralGenomeSize2015,
  abstract     = {It has been suggested that RNA viruses and other subcellular entities endowed with RNA genomes are relicts from an ancient RNA/protein World which is believed to have preceded extant DNA/RNA/protein-based cells. According to their proponents, this possibility is supported by the small-genome sizes of RNA viruses and their manifold replication strategies, which have been interpreted as the result of an evolutionary exploration of different alternative genome organizations and replication strategies during early evolutionary stages. At the other extreme are the giant DNA viruses, whose genome sizes can be as large as those of some prokaryotes, and which have been grouped by some authors into a fourth domain of life. As argued here, the comparative analysis of the chemical nature and sizes of the viral genomes reported in GenBank does not reveal any obvious correlation with the phylogenetic history of their hosts. Accordingly, it is somewhat difficult to reconcile the proposal of the putative pre-DNA antiquity of RNA viruses, with their extraordinary diversity in plant hosts and their apparent absence among the Archaea. Other issues related to the genome size of all known viruses and subviral agents and the relationship with their hosts are discussed.},

The 3′ position was esterified by a separate anthranylic derivative (3′-tag) giving specific fluorescent properties to each nucleotide (nt). These nt acted as substrates with several DNA polymerases leading to chain termination. Upon alkali or enzymatic treatment of the terminated DNA chain, free 3′-hydroxyl groups were recovered and found able to undergo chain extension when incubated with a mixture of dNTPs and a DNA polymerase. Because each tag has different fluorescent properties in itself i.e., as a free acid, it theoretically is possible, after removal and characterization of the tag, to infer which nt has been inserted. Reiteration of the process can then be used to determine a nt sequence with a non-gelbased method amenable to automation.},

  abstract   = {Viruses are infectious obligate intracellular parasites consisting of an RNA or DNA genome in a protective coat. Virus particles cannot increase in size but are assembled from pre-formed components in susceptible host cells. The assembly of virus particles is achieved by the information contained within the components of the particle, a process driven by the rules of symmetry and by the most thermodynamically stable configuration. Once formed, virus particles vary in stability, some being very fragile while others are extremely stable, enabling some viruses to maintain the infectivity of their genome for extended periods of time outside a host cell, a feature required by viruses which are transmitted environmentally rather than directly from host to host. The outer surface of the virus particle must be able to interact with a suitable host cell to enable the process of infection to occur. Key Concepts Virus particles (virions) are assembled from pre-formed components and do not grow or divide. The virus coat protects the virus genome from degradation and helps maintain infectivity. The assembly of virus particles is driven by the components making up the particle and is driven by symmetry and thermodynamics. In some cases, temporary “scaffolding proteins” are used to help direct the assembly of the particle into the mature form. Virus particles must interact with the host cell to establish the process of infection. Virus particles vary in stability, some being very fragile while others are very tough and able to persist in the environment for extended periods of time.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology allows us to determine the sequence of nucleotides of many millions of DNA molecules in parallel. Accompanied by a dramatic reduction in cost since its introduction in 2004, NGS technology has provided a new way of addressing a wide range of biological and biomedical questions, from the study of human genetic disease to the analysis of gene expression, protein-DNA interactions, and patterns of DNA methylation. The data generated by NGS instruments comprise huge numbers of very short DNA sequences, or “reads,” that carry little information by themselves. These reads therefore have to be pieced together by well-engineered algorithms to reconstruct biologically meaningful measurements, such as the level of expression of a gene. To solve this complex, high-dimensional puzzle, reads must be mapped back to a reference genome to determine their origin. Due to sequencing errors and to genuine differences between the reference genome and the individual being sequenced, this mapping process must be tolerant of mismatches, insertions, and deletions. Although optimal alignment algorithms to solve this problem have long been available, the practical requirements of aligning hundreds of millions of short reads to the 3-billion-base-pair-long human genome have stimulated the development of new, more efficient methods, which today are used routinely throughout the world for the analysis of NGS data.},

@misc{cartesAccurateFastClade2022,
  abstract  = {Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been an explosion of sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, making it the most widely sequenced virus in the history. Several databases and tools have been created to keep track of genome sequences and variants of the virus, most notably the GISAID platform hosts millions of complete genome sequences, and it is continuously expanding every day. A challenging task is the development of fast and accurate tools that are able to distinguish between the different SARS-CoV-2 variants and assign them to a clade. Results: In this paper, we leverage the Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop an original method that learns how to classify genome sequences that we implement into CouGaR-g, a tool for the clade assignment problem on SARS-CoV-2 sequences. On a testing subset of the GISAID, CouGaR-g achieves an 96.29\% overall accuracy, while a similar tool, Covidex, obtained a 77,12\% overall accuracy. As far as we know, our method is the first using Deep Learning and FCGR for intra-species classification. Furthermore, by using some feature importance methods CouGaR-g allows to identify k-mers that matches SARS-CoV-2 marker variants. Conclusions: By combining FCGR and CNNs, we develop a method that achieves a better accuracy than Covidex (which is based on Random Forest) for clade assignment of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, also thanks to our training on a much larger dataset, with comparable running times. Our method implemented in CouGaR-g is able to detect k-mers that capture relevant biological information that distinguishes the clades, known as marker variants. Availability: The trained models can be tested online providing a FASTA file (with one or multiple sequences) at https://huggingface.co/spaces/BIASLab/sars-cov-2-classification-fcgr.

@article{cartwrightLogarithmicGapCosts2006,
  abstract     = {Background Studies on the distribution of indel sizes have consistently found that they obey a power law. This finding has lead several scientists to propose that logarithmic gap costs, G (k) = a + c ln k, are more biologically realistic than affine gap costs, G (k) = a + bk, for sequence alignment. Since quick and efficient affine costs are currently the most popular way to globally align sequences, the goal of this paper is to determine whether logarithmic gap costs improve alignment accuracy significantly enough the merit their use over the faster affine gap costs. Results A group of simulated sequences pairs were globally aligned using affine, logarithmic, and log-affine gap costs. Alignment accuracy was calculated by comparing resulting alignments to actual alignments of the sequence pairs. Gap costs were then compared based on average alignment accuracy. Log-affine gap costs had the best accuracy, followed closely by affine gap costs, while logarithmic gap costs performed poorly. Subsequently a model was developed to explain the results. Conclusion In contrast to initial expectations, logarithmic gap costs produce poor alignments and are actually not implied by the power-law behavior of gap sizes, given typical match and mismatch costs. Furthermore, affine gap costs not only produce accurate alignments but are also good approximations to biologically realistic gap costs. This work provides added confidence for the biological relevance of existing alignment algorithms.},

Here we present an expectation–maximization algorithm built on a pair hidden Markov model that is able to properly handle indels in neutrally evolving DNA sequences. From a data set of orthologous introns, we estimate relative rates and length distributions of indels among primates and rodents. This technique has the advantage of potentially handling large genomic data sets. We find that a zeta power-law model of indel lengths provides a much better fit than the traditional geometric model and that indel processes are conserved between our taxa. The estimated relative rates are about 12–16 indels per 100 substitutions, and the estimated power-law magnitudes are about 1.6–1.7. More significantly, we find that using the traditional geometric/affine model of indel lengths introduces artifacts into evolutionary analysis, casting doubt on studies of the evolution and diversity of indel formation using traditional models and invalidating measures of species divergence that include indel lengths.},

We also examine the effect that calibrating the models via Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression has on their performance. An important aspect of our study is the use of a variety of performance criteria to evaluate the learning methods.},

  abstract     = {We studied the relationship between recombination and the fixation time of multiple drug-resistance mutations after HIV-1 drug therapy, under a set of different realistic scenarios. We have generalized a previous model by Bretscher and coworkers in order to explore different implementations of phenotypic mixing and more realistic demographic and selective regimes. Using computer simulations we show that the effect of recombination on the evolution of drug resistance depends strongly on the intensity of selection, as well as on the viral population size. Under the high selection pressure expected during antiretroviral therapy, the strength of the Hill-Robertson effect increases and recombination favors the evolution of resistance under a wide range of population sizes, independently of the sign of the epistatic interaction. Our results suggest that recombination plays an important role in the evolution of drug resistance in HIV-1 under various realistic scenarios. These findings could be taken into account in order to develop optimal HIV-1 drug treatments.},

@article{casariSequencespaceToolFamily1995,
  abstract     = {The biological activity of a protein typically depends on the presence of a small number of functional residues. Identifying these residues from the amino acid sequences alone would be useful. Classically, strictly conserved residues are predicted to be functional but often conservation patterns are more complicated. Here, we present a novel method that exploits such patterns for the prediction of functional residues. The method uses a simple but powerful representation of entire proteins, as well as sequence residues as vectors in a generalised `sequence space'. Projection of these vectors onto a lower-dimensional space reveals groups of residues specific for particular subfamilies that are predicted to be directly involved in protein function. Based on the method we present testable predictions for sets of functional residues in SH2 domains and in the conserved box of cyclins.},

@article{cassanConcomitantEmergenceAntisense2016,
  abstract     = {Recent experiments provide sound arguments in favor of the in vivo expression of the AntiSense Protein (ASP) of HIV-1. This putative protein is encoded on the antisense strand of the provirus genome and entirely overlapped by the env gene with reading frame −2. The existence of ASP was suggested in 1988, but is still controversial, and its function has yet to be determined. We used a large dataset of ∼23,000 HIV-1 and SIV sequences to study the origin, evolution, and conservation of the asp gene. We found that the ASP ORF is specific to group M of HIV-1, which is responsible for the human pandemic. Moreover, the correlation between the presence of asp and the prevalence of HIV-1 groups and M subtypes appeared to be statistically significant. We then looked for evidence of selection pressure acting on asp. Using computer simulations, we showed that the conservation of the ASP ORF in the group M could not be due to chance. Standard methods were ineffective in disentangling the two selection pressures imposed by both the Env and ASP proteins—an expected outcome with overlaps in frame −2. We thus developed a method based on careful evolutionary analysis of the presence/absence of stop codons, revealing that ASP does impose significant selection pressure. All of these results support the idea that asp is the 10th gene of HIV-1 group M and indicate a correlation with the spread of the pandemic.},

Our novel surface chemistry approach ensures accurate identification of correct bases at individual positions along a targeted DNA sequence on the gold surface. Binding of the correct base on the gold sensing surface triggers strong spectral variations within the nanohole optical response, which provides a high signal-to-noise ratio and accurate sequence data. Integrating our label-free sequencing platform with a lens-free imaging-based device, we reliably determined targeted DNA sequences by monitoring the changes within the plasmonic diffraction images. Consequently, this new label-free surface chemistry technique, integrated with plasmonic lens-free imaging platform, will enable monitoring multiple biomolecular binding events, which could initiate new avenues for high-throughput nucleic acid sequencing.},

  abstract     = {To compare the newly determined sequences against the subject sequences stored in the databases is a critical job in the bioinformatics. Fortunately, recent survey reports that the state-of-the-art aligners are already fast enough to handle the ultra amount of short sequence reads in the reasonable time. However, for aligning the long sequence reads ({$>$}400 bp) generated by the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, it is still quite inefficient with present aligners. Furthermore, the challenge becomes more and more serious as the lengths and the amounts of the sequence reads are both keeping increasing with the improvement of the sequencing technology. Thus, it is extremely urgent for the researchers to enhance the performance of the long read alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel FPGA-based system to improve the efficiency of the long read mapping. Compared to the state-of-the-art long read aligner BWA-SW, our accelerating platform could achieve a high performance with almost the same sensitivity. Experiments demonstrate that, for reads with lengths ranging from 512 up to 4,096 base pairs, the described system obtains a 10x -48x speedup for the bottleneck of the software. As to the whole mapping procedure, the FPGA-based platform could achieve a 1.8x -3:3x speedup versus the BWA-SW aligner, reducing the alignment cycles from weeks to days.},

To test this hypothesis, SIVs from eight sooty mangabeys, including six new viruses from West Africa, were genetically characterized. gag and env sequences showed that while the viruses of all eight sooty mangabeys belonged to the SIVsm/HIV-2 family, each was widely divergent from SIVs found earlier in captive monkeys at American primate centers. In two SIVs from sooty mangabeys discovered about 100 miles (ca. 161 Km) from each other in rural West Africa, the amino acids of a conserved gag p17-p26 region differed by 19.3\%, a divergence greater than that in four of five clades of HIV-2 and in SIVs found in other African monkey species. Analysis of gag region sequences showed that feral mangabeys in one small troop harbored four distinct SIVs. Three of the newly found viruses were genetically divergent, showing as much genetic distance from each other as from the entire SIVsm/HIV-2 family. Sequencing and heteroduplex analysis of one feral animal-derived SIV showed a mosaic genome containing an env gene that was homologous with other feral SIVsm env genes in the troop but having a gag gene from another, distinct SIV. Surprisingly a gag phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences showed that the African relatives closest to all three household-derived SIVs were HIV-2 subtypes D and E from humans in the same West African areas. In one case, the SIV/HIV-2 cluster was from the same village. The findings support the hypothesis that each HIV-2 subtype in West Africans originated from widely divergent SIVsm strains, transmitted by independent cross-species events in the same geographic locations.},

@article{chengFMtreeFastLocating2018,
  abstract     = {As a fundamental task in bioinformatics, searching for massive short patterns over a long text has been accelerated by various compressed full-text indexes. These indexes are able to provide similar searching functionalities to classical indexes, e.g. suffix trees and suffix arrays, while requiring less space. For genomic data, a well-known family of compressed full-text indexes, called FM-indexes, presents unmatched performance in practice. One major drawback of FM-indexes is that their locating operations, which report all occurrence positions of patterns in a given text, are not efficient, especially for the patterns with many occurrences.In this paper, we introduce a novel locating algorithm, FMtree, to fast retrieve all occurrence positions of any pattern via FM-indexes. When searching for a pattern over a given text, FMtree organizes the search space of the locating operation into a conceptual multiway tree. As a result, multiple occurrence positions of this pattern can be retrieved simultaneously by traversing the multiway tree. Compared with existing locating algorithms, our tree-based algorithm reduces large numbers of redundant operations and presents better data locality. Experimental results show that FMtree is usually one order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms, and still memory-efficient.FMtree is freely available at https://github.com/chhylp123/FMtree.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning methods are widely used in bioinformatics and computational and systems biology. Here, we review the development of machine learning methods for protein structure prediction, one of the most fundamental problems in structural biology and bioinformatics. Protein structure prediction is such a complex problem that it is often decomposed and attacked at four different levels: 1-D prediction of structural features along the primary sequence of amino acids; 2-D prediction of spatial relationships between amino acids; 3-D prediction of the tertiary structure of a protein; and 4-D prediction of the quaternary structure of a multiprotein complex. A diverse set of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods has been applied over the years to tackle these problems and has significantly contributed to advancing the state-of-the-art of protein structure prediction. In this paper, we review the development and application of hidden Markov models, neural networks, support vector machines, Bayesian methods, and clustering methods in 1-D, 2-D, 3-D, and 4-D protein structure predictions.},

This paper reviews the relevant background literature on the contributions of social and behavioural science to non-adherence to HIV medications. Data indicating problems with adherence prior to combination therapy are reported. Despite limitations, even self-report assessments have already succeeded in showing that adherence to combination therapy is significantly related to HIV viral load.

However, the representation of the de Bruijn graph in memory is a computational bottleneck for many assemblers. Recent papers proposed a navigational data structure approach in order to improve memory usage. We prove several theoretical space lower bounds to show the limitations of these types of approaches. We further design and implement a general data structure (dbgfm) and demonstrate its use on a human whole-genome dataset, achieving space usage of 1.5 GB and a 46\% improvement over previous approaches. As part of dbgfm, we develop the notion of frequency-based minimizers and show how it can be used to enumerate all maximal simple paths of the de Bruijn graph using only 43 MB of memory. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach can be integrated into an existing assembler by modifying the ABySS software to use dbgfm.},

To employ CNN, the input DNA sequences are required to be encoded as numerical values and represented as either vectors or multi-dimensional matrices. This paper evaluated a simple and more compact ordinal encoding method versus the popular one-hot encoding for DNA sequences. We compared the performances of both encoding methods using three sets of datasets enriched with DNA motifs. We found that the ordinal encoding performs comparable to the one-hot method but with significant reduction in training time. In addition, the one-hot encoding performances were rather consistent across various datasets but would require suitable CNN configuration to perform well. The ordinal encoding with matrix representation performed best in some of the evaluated datasets. This study implied that the performances of CNN for DNA motif discovery depends on the suitable design of the sequence encoding and representation. The good performances of the ordinal encoding method demonstrates that there are still rooms for improvement for the one-hot encoding method.},

However, concern over the cost of training the attention mechanism to learn complex dependencies between distant inputs continues to grow. In response, solutions that exploit the structure and sparsity of the learned attention matrix have blossomed. However, real-world applications that involve long sequences, such as biological sequence analysis, may fall short of meeting these assumptions, precluding exploration of these models. To address this challenge, we present a new Transformer architecture, Performer, based on Fast Attention Via Orthogonal Random features (FAVOR). Our mechanism scales linearly rather than quadratically in the number of tokens in the sequence, is characterized by sub-quadratic space complexity and does not incorporate any sparsity pattern priors. Furthermore, it provides strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased estimation of the attention matrix and uniform convergence. It is also backwards-compatible with pre-trained regular Transformers. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the challenging task of protein sequence modeling and provide detailed theoretical analysis.},

Although protein alignment problem has been studied for several decades, unfortunately, every available method produces alignment results differently for a single alignment problem. Multiple sequence alignment is characterized as a very high computational complex problem. Many stochastic methods, therefore, are considered for improving the accuracy of alignment. Among them, many researchers frequently use Genetic Algorithm. In this study, we have shown different types of the method applied in alignment and the recent trends in the multiobjective genetic algorithm for solving multiple sequence alignment.

Methylated cytosine can also be distinguished from the four standard DNA bases: guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine.

  abstract     = {Background:\~         HIV-1 hypersusceptibility to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) improves the response to NNRTI-containing regimens. The genetic basis for NNRTI hypersusceptibility was partly defined in our earlier analyses of a paired genotype–phenotype dataset of viral isolates from treatment-experienced patients, in which we identified reverse transcriptase mutations V118I, H208Y, and T215Y as being strongly associated with NNRTI hypersusceptibility.         Objectives:\~         We evaluated the role of these mutations in NNRTI hypersusceptibility by site-directed mutagenesis and phenotypic analysis of HIV-1 recombinants.         Methods:\~         Drug susceptibility and replication capacity were determined in single cycle assays. Hypersusceptibility was defined by a statistically significant (P {$<$} 0.01; Student's t-test) mean fold-change in 50\% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of less than 0.4.         Results:\~         The single mutations V118I, H208Y, and T215Y did not show hypersusceptibility to efavirenz with mean fold-change of 0.58, 0.55, and 0.70, respectively (P {$<$} 0.01 and P = 0.12). The H208Y/T215Y and V118I/H208Y/T215Y mutants showed marked hypersusceptibility to efavirenz, having mean fold-change values of 0.27 and 0.20, respectively (P {$<$} 0.001). In addition, H208Y/T215Y, V118I/T215Y, and V118I/H208Y/T215Y were hypersusceptible to delavirdine and nevirapine. The V118I/T215Y mutant was not replication impaired; whereas H208Y/T215Y and V118I/H208Y/T215Y had significantly (P {$<$} 0.01) reduced replication capacities of 40 and 35\% of wild-type, respectively.         Conclusion:\~         Different combinations of V118I, H208Y, and T215Y produce NNRTI hypersusceptibility. The V118I/T215Y mutant is hypersusceptible to delavirdine and nevirapine without reduced replication capacity, whereas the H208Y/T215Y and V118I/H208Y/T215Y mutants are hypersusceptible to all NNRTI and show impaired replication. These findings suggest that more than one mechanism is involved in NNRTI hypersusceptibility.},

@article{clutterHIV1DrugResistance2016,
  abstract     = {The global scale-up of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (ART) has led to dramatic reductions in HIV-1 mortality and incidence. However, HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) poses a potential threat to the long-term success of ART and is emerging as a threat to the elimination of AIDS as a public health problem by 2030. In this review we describe the genetic mechanisms, epidemiology, and management of HIVDR at both individual and population levels across diverse economic and geographic settings. To describe the genetic mechanisms of HIVDR, we review the genetic barriers to resistance for the most commonly used ARVs and describe the extent of cross-resistance between them. To describe the epidemiology of HIVDR, we summarize the prevalence and patterns of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and acquired drug resistance (ADR) in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We also review to two categories of HIVDR with important public health relevance: (i) pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR), a World Health Organization-recommended HIVDR surveillance metric and (ii) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-related drug resistance, a type of ADR that can impact clinical outcomes if present at the time of treatment initiation. To summarize the implications of HIVDR for patient management, we review the role of genotypic resistance testing and treatment practices in both high-income and LMIC settings. In high-income countries where drug resistance testing is part of routine care, such an understanding can help clinicians prevent virological failure and accumulation of further HIVDR on an individual level by selecting the most efficacious regimens for their patients. Although there is reduced access to diagnostic testing and to many ARVs in LMIC, understanding the scientific basis and clinical implications of HIVDR is useful in all regions in order to shape appropriate surveillance, inform treatment algorithms, and manage difficult cases.},

In addition to the gag, pol, and env open reading frames (ORFs) present in all retroviruses, lentiviral genomes also contain novel ORFs generally not found in prototypic retroviruses. These ORFs code for a variety of auxiliary proteins which account for the tight and often intricate regulation of gene expression observed in lentiviruses. Auxiliary protein involvement in viral replication has been particularly well characterized in the most extensively studied member of the lentiviral subfamily, the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).},

@inproceedings{correiaAdaptivelySparseTransformers2019,
  abstract   = {Attention mechanisms have become ubiquitous in NLP. Recent architectures, notably the Transformer, learn powerful context-aware word representations through layered, multi-headed attention. The multiple heads learn diverse types of word relationships. However, with standard softmax attention, all attention heads are dense, assigning a non-zero weight to all context words. In this work, we introduce the adaptively sparse Transformer, wherein attention heads have flexible, context-dependent sparsity patterns. This sparsity is accomplished by replacing softmax with alpha-entmax: a differentiable generalization of softmax that allows low-scoring words to receive precisely zero weight. Moreover, we derive a method to automatically learn the alpha parameter – which controls the shape and sparsity of alpha-entmax – allowing attention heads to choose between focused or spread-out behavior. Our adaptively sparse Transformer improves interpretability and head diversity when compared to softmax Transformers on machine translation datasets. Findings of the quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach include that heads in different layers learn different sparsity preferences and tend to be more diverse in their attention distributions than softmax Transformers. Furthermore, at no cost in accuracy, sparsity in attention heads helps to uncover different head specializations.},

@inproceedings{corsoNeuralDistanceEmbeddings2021,
  abstract  = {The development of data-dependent heuristics and representations for biological sequences that reflect their evolutionary distance is critical for large-scale biological research. However, popular machine learning approaches, based on continuous Euclidean spaces, have struggled with the discrete combinatorial formulation of the edit distance that models evolution and the hierarchical relationship that characterises real-world datasets. We present Neural Distance Embeddings (NeuroSEED), a general framework to embed sequences in geometric vector spaces, and illustrate the effectiveness of the hyperbolic space that captures the hierarchical structure and provides an average 38\% reduction in embedding RMSE against the best competing geometry. The capacity of the framework and the significance of these improvements are then demonstrated devising supervised and unsupervised NeuroSEED approaches to multiple core tasks in bioinformatics. Benchmarked with common baselines, the proposed approaches display significant accuracy and/or runtime improvements on real-world datasets. As an example for hierarchical clustering, the proposed pretrained and from-scratch methods match the quality of competing baselines with 30x and 15x runtime reduction, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Rates of spontaneous mutation critically determine the genetic diversity and evolution of RNA viruses. Although these rates have been characterized in vitro and in cell culture models, they have seldom been determined in vivo for human viruses. Here, we use the intrapatient frequency of premature stop codons to quantify the HIV-1 genome-wide rate of spontaneous mutation in DNA sequences from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This reveals an extremely high mutation rate of (4.1 ± 1.7) × 10−3 per base per cell, the highest reported for any biological entity. Sequencing of plasma-derived sequences yielded a mutation frequency 44 times lower, indicating that a large fraction of viral genomes are lethally mutated and fail to reach plasma. We show that the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase contributes only 2\% of mutations, whereas 98\% result from editing by host cytidine deaminases of the A3 family. Hypermutated viral sequences are less abundant in patients showing rapid disease progression compared to normal progressors, highlighting the antiviral role of A3 proteins. However, the amount of A3-mediated editing varies broadly, and we find that low-edited sequences are more abundant among rapid progressors, suggesting that suboptimal A3 activity might enhance HIV-1 genetic diversity and pathogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Summary:\~         Although understanding of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance is less clearly established than that of other classes of antiretroviral drugs, certain facts have been established. The treatment-associated genetic mutation profiles of the available NNRTIs have been mapped, and resistance has been found to develop rapidly after initiation of NNRTI therapy. Despite the chemical diversity of the NNRTIs, cross-resistance among agents of this class is nearly universal. Although the viral replicative capacity (“fitness”) of NNRTI-induced viral variants has not been extensively studied, available data suggest that NNRTI-selected mutations confer little damage to viral fitness, and thus a single point mutation produces a strain that is both resistant and fit. Furthermore, with continued therapy, viral evolution persists, creating species with greater numbers of mutations and higher level phenotypic resistance. Taken together, these facts suggest that continued use of NNRTIs after emergence of resistance will produce variants of complex mutational patterns that limit future treatment options, and, therefore, strong consideration should be given to discontinuing NNRTIs after virologic failure is confirmed. This article describes the scientific literature establishing the efficacy and limitations of NNRTI therapy and attempts to define a role for this class of drug in the long-term treatment of HIV-1 disease.},

  abstract     = {Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ (ONT) long read sequencers offer access to longer DNA fragments than previous sequencer generations, at the cost of a higher error rate. While many papers have studied read correction methods, few have addressed the detailed characterization of observed errors, a task complicated by frequent changes in chemistry and software in ONT technology. The MinION sequencer is now more stable and this paper proposes an up-to-date view of its error landscape, using the most mature flowcell and basecaller. We studied Nanopore sequencing error biases on both bacterial and human DNA reads. We found that, although Nanopore sequencing is expected not to suffer from GC bias, it is a crucial parameter with respect to errors. In particular, low-GC reads have fewer errors than high-GC reads (about 6\% and 8\% respectively). The error profile for homopolymeric regions or regions with short repeats, the source of about half of all sequencing errors, also depends on the GC rate and mainly shows deletions, although there are some reads with long insertions. Another interesting finding is that the quality measure, although over-estimated, offers valuable information to predict the error rate as well as the abundance of reads. We supplemented this study with an analysis of a rapeseed RNA read set and shown a higher level of errors with a higher level of deletion in these data. Finally, we have implemented an open source pipeline for long-term monitoring of the error profile, which enables users to easily compute various analysis presented in this work, including for future developments of the sequencing device. Overall, we hope this work will provide a basis for the design of better error-correction methods.},

@article{delbrockBacterialVirusesBacteriophages1946,
  abstract     = {(i) The following factors are held to be chiefly responsible for recent progress in the field of bacterial viruses: (a) the introduction of ‘one-step growth experiments’, (b) the concentration of attention on a small group of bacterial viruses, (c) the proof that virus-resistant mutants originate independently of the presence of virus, (d) the application of the electron microscope. (2) Types of virus morphology, as revealed by the electron microscope, are described. The virus particles of any one strain are of uniform size and shape. Many strains show a ‘head-and-tail’ structure. Sizes between 45 and 100 mμ have been found. (3) Classification of a group of seven viruses by serological cross reactions agrees perfectly with classification by morphology. (4) A method for determining the origin of mutations of bacteria from virus sensitivity to virus resistance is outlined. There is evidence that the classification of viruses by cross-resistance tests is of little value in establishing natural relationships between viruses. (5) The phenomenon of ‘lysogenesis’ is discussed, and certain ambiguities in its definition are pointed out. (6) The physiological basis of resistance of a bacterial strain to the attack by a specific virus is discussed. Such resistance is generally coupled with failure on the part of the bacteria to fix the virus in question by adsorption. Evidence shedding a new light on the process of adsorption is reported. (7) Bacterial viruses can mutate in such a way that their host range is altered. These mutations occur during the multiplication of the virus in its host. (8) The technique and terminology of ‘one-step growth experiments’ are briefly described. (9) When a bacterium is attacked simultaneously by several virus particles of the same strain or of different strains the bacterium reacts as if it had been attacked by only one particle (mutual exclusion effect). A detailed study of this phenomenon has led to the assumption that the membrane of the bacterium becomes impermeable to other virus particles after one particle has entered the cell (penetration hypothesis). The excluded virus particles may affect the yield of virus of the successful type (depressor effect). (10) The adaptation of the technique of the ‘one-step growth experiment’ to biochemical studies of virus multiplication is described. (n) The controversies regarding the nature of bacterial viruses are briefly touched upon, particularly with reference to the evolutionary standing of these viruses. (12) It is pointed out that a thorough study of bacterial viruses may lead to a better understanding of all types of viruses.},

The new system, MUMmer 2, runs three times faster while using one-third as much memory as the original MUMmer system.

A new module permits the alignment of multiple DNA sequence fragments, which has proven valuable in the comparison of incomplete genome sequences. We also describe a method to align more distantly related genomes by detecting protein sequence homology. This extension to MUMmer aligns two genomes after translating the sequence in all six reading frames, extracts all matching protein sequences and then clusters together matches. This method has been applied to both incomplete and complete genome sequences in order to detect regions of conserved synteny, in which multiple proteins from one organism are found in the same order and orientation in another.

  abstract     = {Integration of retroviral DNA is an obligatory step of retrovirus replication because proviral DNA is the template for productive infection. Integrase, a retroviral enzyme, catalyses integration. The process of integration can be divided into two sequential reactions. The first one, named 3'-processing, corresponds to a specific endonucleolytic reaction which prepares the viral DNA extremities to be competent for the subsequent covalent insertion, named strand transfer, into the host cell genome by a trans-esterification reaction. Recently, a novel specific activity of the full length integrase was reported, in vitro, by our group for two retroviral integrases (HIV-1 and PFV-1). This activity of internal cleavage occurs at a specific palindromic sequence mimicking the LTR-LTR junction described into the 2-LTR circles which are peculiar viral DNA forms found during viral infection. Moreover, recent studies demonstrated the existence of a weak palindromic consensus found at the integration sites. Taken together, these data underline the propensity of retroviral integrases for binding symmetrical sequences and give perspectives for targeting specific sequences used for gene therapy.},

Using linear non-threshold model (LNT), possible risks from exposure to low dose ionizing radiation (below 100\~mSv) are estimated by extrapolating from data obtained after exposure to higher doses of radiation. This model has been challenged by numerous observations, in which cells that were not directly traversed by the ionizing radiation exhibited responses similar to those of the directly irradiated cells. Therefore, it is nowadays accepted that the detrimental effects of ionizing radiation are not restricted only in the irradiated cells, but also to non-irradiated bystander or even distant cells manifesting various biological effects.},

Where applicable, the amino acids were replaced by the corresponding amino acids present in HIV-2 RT. The amino acid residues Y181 and Y188 appeared to be critical for the anti-HIV-1 RT activity of the TIBO derivatives, since substitution of these residues by the corresponding HIV-2 amino acids I181 and L188 resulted in a virtual loss of TIBO sensitivity without loss of enzymatic activity.},

K-means clustering is a commonly used data clustering for performing unsupervised learning tasks. Here we prove that principal components are the continuous solutions to the discrete cluster membership indicators for K-means clustering. New lower bounds for K-means objective function are derived, which is the total variance minus the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. These results indicate that unsupervised dimension reduction is closely related to unsupervised learning. Several implications are discussed. On dimension reduction, the result provides new insights to the observed effectiveness of PCA-based data reductions, beyond the conventional noise-reduction explanation that PCA, via singular value decomposition, provides the best low-dimensional linear approximation of the data. On learning, the result suggests effective techniques for K-means data clustering. DNA gene expression and Internet newsgroups are analyzed to illustrate our results. Experiments indicate that the new bounds are within 0.5-1.5\% of the optimal values.},

However, these reads display high error rates, and correction steps are necessary to realize their great potential in genomics and transcriptomics. Here, we compare properties of PacBio and Nanopore data and assess correction methods by Canu, MARVEL and proovread in various combinations. We found total error rates of around 13\% in the raw datasets. PacBio reads showed a high rate of insertions (around 8\%) whereas Nanopore reads showed similar rates for substitutions, insertions and deletions of around 4\% each. In data from both technologies the errors were uniformly distributed along reads apart from noisy 5′ ends, and homopolymers appeared among the most over-represented kmers relative to a reference. Consensus correction using read overlaps reduced error rates to about 1\% when using Canu or MARVEL after patching. The lowest error rate in Nanopore data (0.45\%) was achieved by applying proovread on MARVEL-patched data including Illumina short-reads, and the lowest error rate in PacBio data (0.42\%) was the result of Canu correction with minimap2 alignment after patching.

They are associated with important diseases such as human influenza, newly emerging haemorrhagic fevers or several forms of hepatitis. Virus particles are disparate in size, shape and composition, and enclose an RNA genome that can be either single stranded, double stranded, nonsegmented or segmented. Application of deep sequencing methodologies has unveiled their great abundance and ubiquity. The structural diversity of viral RNA is reflected in differences in their replication cycles that are completed through complex interactions between viral and host proteins. RNA viruses share error-prone replication that confers on them the capacity to adapt to a wide range of environments. Despite considerable progress in the understanding of virus structure and expression of their genetic programmes, the success of preventive and control strategies has been limited.

  abstract   = {Viruses are transmissible deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) genetic elements that require a cell for multiplication. Viruses are extremely diverse and ubiquitous in nature. They evolve in continuous interaction with their host cells and organisms, following the general Darwinian principles: genetic variation, competition among variant forms and selection of the most fit variants in a given environment. Viruses probably had an ancient origin and have survived as agents of gene transfer and promoters of cell variation. Evolution of RNA viruses and some DNA viruses can be extremely rapid, fuelled by limited template-copying fidelity of the replicating polymerases. They form extremely complex mutant clouds termed viral quasispecies, which can acquire features not explainable from the individuals that compose the ensemble. Quasispecies dynamics not only represent a problem for disease prevention and control, but it has inspired new strategies to combat viral disease. One of them is lethal mutagenesis or viral extinction driven by an excess of mutations, often produced by mutagenic nucleotide analogues. New antiviral designs based on lethal mutagenesis are currently under investigation. Key Concepts: Virions are the virus particles produced on completion of the intracellular replication cycle. Interhost transmission of virions can give rise to disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics. Metagenomic studies using deep sequencing methods have unveiled great diversity of viruses in many natural habitats. The ensemble of viruses in our biosphere is termed the ‘virosphere’. Evidence from comparative genomics suggests a long coevolution of cells and viruses on Earth. Recombination and horizontal gene transfers between viral and cellular genes have been abundant during evolution of life. Some proteins that play physiological functions in cells can be recruited as part of the innate immunity against viruses.

@article{doProbConsProbabilisticConsistencybased2005,
  abstract     = {To study gene evolution across a wide range of organisms, biologists need accurate tools for multiple sequence alignment of protein families. Obtaining accurate alignments, however, is a difficult computational problem because of not only the high computational cost but also the lack of proper objective functions for measuring alignment quality. In this paper, we introduce probabilistic consistency, a novel scoring function for multiple sequence comparisons. We present ProbCons, a practical tool for progressive protein multiple sequence alignment based on probabilistic consistency, and evaluate its performance on several standard alignment benchmark data sets. On the BAliBASE, SABmark, and PREFAB benchmark alignment databases, ProbCons achieves statistically significant improvement over other leading methods while maintaining practical speed. ProbCons is publicly available as a Web resource.},

@article{doron-faigenboimCombinedEmpiricalMechanistic2007,
  abstract     = {The evolutionary selection forces acting on a protein are commonly inferred using evolutionary codon models by contrasting the rate of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions. Most widely used models are based on theoretical assumptions and ignore the empirical observation that distinct amino acids differ in their replacement rates. In this paper, we develop a general method that allows assimilation of empirical amino acid replacement probabilities into a codon-substitution matrix. In this way, the resulting codon model takes into account not only the transition–transversion bias and the nonsynonymous/synonymous ratio, but also the different amino acid replacement probabilities as specified in empirical amino acid matrices. Different empirical amino acid replacement matrices, such as secondary structure–specific matrices or organelle-specific matrices (e.g., mitochondria and chloroplasts), can be incorporated into the model, making it context dependent. Using a diverse set of coding DNA sequences, we show that the novel model better fits biological data as compared with either mechanistic or empirical codon models. Using the suggested model, we further analyze human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease sequences obtained from drug-treated patients and reveal positive selection in sites that are known to confer drug resistance to the virus.},

BetaAlign accounts for the possible variability of the evolutionary process among different datasets by using an ensemble of transformers, each trained on millions of samples generated from a different evolutionary model. Our approach leads to outstanding alignment accuracy, often outperforming commonly used methods, such as MAFFT, DIALIGN, ClustalW, T-Coffee, and MUSCLE.

@article{draghiciPredictingHIVDrug2003,
  abstract     = {Motivation: Drug resistance is a very important factor influencing the failure of current HIV therapies.  The ability to predict the drug resistance of HIV protease mutants may be useful in developing more effective and longer lasting treatment regimens.Methods: The HIV resistance is predicted to two current protease inhibitors, Indinavir and Saquinavir. The problem was approached from two perspectives. First, a predictor was constructed based on the structural features of the HIV protease–drug inhibitor complex. A particular structure was represented by its list of contacts between the inhibitor and the protease. Next, a classifier was constructed based on the sequence data of various drug resistant mutants. In both cases, self-organizing maps were first used to extract the important features and cluster the patterns in an unsupervised manner. This was followed by subsequent labelling based on the known patterns in the training set.Results: The prediction performance of the classifiers was measured by cross-validation. The classifier using the structure information correctly classified previously unseen mutants with an accuracy of between 60 and 70\%. Several architectures were tested on the more abundant sequence data. The best single classifier provided an accuracy of 68\% and a coverage of 69\%. Multiple networks were then combined into various majority voting schemes. The best combination yielded an average of 85\% coverage and 78\% accuracy on previously unseen data. This is more than two times better than the 33\% accuracy expected from a random classifier.Contact: sod@cs.wayne.edu*To whom correspondence should be addressed.},

  abstract     = {Background.{$\\quad$}Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmitted drug resistance (TDR) can compromise antiretroviral therapy (ART) and thus represents an important public health concern. Typically, sources of TDR remain unknown, but they can be characterized with molecular epidemiologic approaches. We used the highly representative Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and linked drug resistance database (SHCS-DRDB) to analyze sources of TDR.Methods.{$\\quad$}ART-naive men who have sex with men with infection date estimates between 1996 and 2009 were chosen for surveillance of TDR in HIV-1 subtype B (N = 1674), as the SHCS-DRDB contains pre-ART genotypic resistance tests for \&gt;69\% of this surveillance population. A phylogeny was inferred using pol sequences from surveillance patients and all subtype B sequences from the SHCS-DRDB (6934 additional patients). Potential sources of TDR were identified based on phylogenetic clustering, shared resistance mutations, genetic distance, and estimated infection dates.Results.{$\\quad$}One hundred forty of 1674 (8.4\%) surveillance patients carried virus with TDR; 86 of 140 (61.4\%) were assigned to clusters. Potential sources of TDR were found for 50 of 86 (58.1\%) of these patients. ART-naive patients constitute 56 of 66 (84.8\%) potential sources and were significantly overrepresented among sources (odds ratio, 6.43 [95\% confidence interval, 3.22–12.82]; P \&lt; .001). Particularly large transmission clusters were observed for the L90M mutation, and the spread of L90M continued even after the near cessation of antiretroviral use selecting for that mutation. Three clusters showed evidence of reversion of K103N or T215Y/F.Conclusions.{$\\quad$}Many individuals harboring viral TDR belonged to transmission clusters with other Swiss patients, indicating substantial domestic transmission of TDR in Switzerland. Most TDR in clusters could be linked to sources, indicating good surveillance of TDR in the SHCS-DRDB. Most TDR sources were ART naive. This, and the presence of long TDR transmission chains, suggests that resistance mutations are frequently transmitted among untreated individuals, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.},

  abstract     = {Motivation:In recent years, several methods have been proposed for aligning two protein sequence profiles, with reported improvements in alignment accuracy and homolog discrimination versus sequence–sequence methods (e.g. BLAST) and profile–sequence methods (e.g. PSI-BLAST). Profile–profile alignment is also the iterated step in progressive multiple sequence alignment algorithms such as CLUSTALW. However, little is known about the relative performance of different profile–profile scoring functions. In this work, we evaluate the alignment accuracy of 23 different profile–profile scoring functions by comparing alignments of 488 pairs of sequences with identity ≤30\% against structural alignments. We optimize parameters for all scoring functions on the same training set and use profiles of alignments from both PSI-BLAST and SAM-T99. Structural alignments are constructed from a consensus between the FSSP database and CE structural aligner. We compare the results with sequence–sequence and sequence–profile methods, including BLAST and PSI-BLAST.Results: We find that profile–profile alignment gives an average improvement over our test set of typically 2–3\% over profile–sequence alignment and ∼40\% over sequence–sequence alignment. No statistically significant difference is seen in the relative performance of most of the scoring functions tested. Significantly better results are obtained with profiles constructed from SAM-T99 alignments than from PSI-BLAST alignments.Availability: Source code, reference alignments and more detailed results are freely available at http://phylogenomics.berkeley.edu/profilealignment/},

Here we developed a cloud computing infrastructure, Serratus, to enable ultra-high-throughput sequence alignment at the petabase scale. We searched 5.7\\,million biologically diverse samples (10.2\\,petabases ) for the hallmark gene RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and identified well over 105 novel RNA viruses, thereby expanding the number of known species by roughly an order of magnitude. We characterized novel viruses related to coronaviruses, hepatitis delta virus and huge phages, respectively, and analysed their environmental reservoirs. To catalyse the ongoing revolution of viral discovery, we established a free and comprehensive database of these data and tools. Expanding the known sequence diversity of viruses can reveal the evolutionary origins of emerging pathogens and improve pathogen surveillance for the anticipation and mitigation of future pandemics.},

@article{edgarSyncmersAreMore2021,
  abstract     = {Minimizers are widely used to select subsets of fixed-length substrings (k-mers) from biological sequences in applications ranging from read mapping to taxonomy prediction and indexing of large datasets. The minimizer of a string of w consecutive k-mers is the k-mer with smallest value according to an ordering of all k-mers. Syncmers are defined here as a family of alternative methods which select k-mers by inspecting the position of the smallest-valued substring of length s {$<$} k within the k-mer. For example, a closed syncmer is selected if its smallest s-mer is at the start or end of the k-mer. At least one closed syncmer must be found in every window of length (k − s) k-mers. Unlike a minimizer, a syncmer is identified by its sequence alone, and is therefore synchronized in the following sense: if a given k-mer is selected from one sequence, it will also be selected from any other sequence. Also, minimizers can be deleted by mutations in flanking sequence, which cannot happen with syncmers. Experiments on minimizers with parameters used in the minimap2 read mapper and Kraken taxonomy prediction algorithm respectively show that syncmers can simultaneously achieve both lower density and higher conservation compared to minimizers.},

A human genome is assembled in under 10\~min using 8 cores and 10 GB RAM, and 60 Gbp of metagenome reads are assembled in 4\~min using 1 GB RAM. In addition, we constructed a minimizer-space de Bruijn graph-based representation of 661,405 bacterial genomes, comprising 16 million nodes and 45 million edges, and successfully search it for anti-microbial resistance (AMR) genes in 12\~min. We expect our advances to be essential to sequence analysis, given the rise of long-read sequencing in genomics, metagenomics, and pangenomics.

  abstract      = {Computational biology and bioinformatics provide vast data gold-mines from protein sequences, ideal for Language Models taken from NLP. These LMs reach for new prediction frontiers at low inference costs. Here, we trained two auto-regressive models (Transformer-XL, XLNet) and four auto-encoder models (BERT, Albert, Electra, T5) on data from UniRef and BFD containing up to 393 billion amino acids. The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer using 5616 GPUs and TPU Pod up-to 1024 cores. Dimensionality reduction revealed that the raw protein LM-embeddings from unlabeled data captured some biophysical features of protein sequences. We validated the advantage of using the embeddings as exclusive input for several subsequent tasks. The first was a per-residue prediction of protein secondary structure (3-state accuracy Q3=81\%-87\%); the second were per-protein predictions of protein sub-cellular localization (ten-state accuracy: Q10=81\%) and membrane vs. water-soluble (2-state accuracy Q2=91\%). For the per-residue predictions the transfer of the most informative embeddings (ProtT5) for the first time outperformed the state-of-the-art without using evolutionary information thereby bypassing expensive database searches. Taken together, the results implied that protein LMs learned some of the grammar of the language of life. To facilitate future work, we released our models at https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans.},

@article{esnoufUniqueFeaturesStructure1997,
  abstract     = {The viral reverse transcriptase (RT) provides an attractive target in the search for anti-HIV therapies. The nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) are a diverse set of compounds (usually HIV-1 specific) that function by distorting the polymerase active site upon binding in a nearby pocket. Despite being potent and of generally low toxicity, their clinical use has been limited by rapid selection for resistant viral populations. The 2.65-A resolution structure of the complex between HIV-1 RT and the bis(heteroaryl)piperazine (BHAP) NNI, 1-(5-methanesulfonamido-1H-indol-2-yl-carbonyl)-4- [3-(1-methyl-ethylamino) pyridinyl] piperazine (U-90152), reveals the inhibitor conformation and bound water molecules. The bulky U-90152 molecule occupies the same pocket as other NNIs, but the complex is stabilized quite differently, in particular by hydrogen bonding to the main chain of Lys-103 and extensive hydrophobic contacts with Pro-236. These interactions rationalize observed resistance mutations, notably Pro-236-Leu, which occurs characteristically for BHAPs. When bound, part of U-90152 protrudes into the solvent creating a channel between Pro-236 and the polypeptide segments 225-226 and 105-106, giving the first clear evidence of the entry mode for NNIs. The structure allows prediction of binding modes for related inhibitors [(altrylamino)piperidine-BHAPs] and suggests changes to U-90152, such as the addition of a 6 amino group to the pyridine ring, which may make binding more resilient to mutations in the RT. The observation of novel hydrogen bonding to the protein main chain may provide lessons for the improvement of quite different inhibitors.},

  abstract  = {This chapter discusses various human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase structure and function. HIV integrase consists of three domains, the structures of that are individually determined by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The chapter discusses the domain structure of HIV-type 1 (HIV-1) Integrase. The core domain, spanning residues 50–212, is responsible for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The crystal structure of a dimer of this domain shows similarity to other proteins that carry out polynucleotidyl transfer, including MuA transposase and Ribonuclease H (RNase H). The small N-terminal domain folds into a dimeric helix-turn-helix structure, which is stabilized by the coordination of zinc with conserved histidine (His) and cysteine (Cys) residues. The chapter also discusses the catalytic core domain of the HIV integrase enzymes. In this reaction, a branched DNA substrate mimicking the product of DNA strand transfer is resolved into its viral DNA and target DNA parts. There is no evidence that disintegration is relevant in vivo, but it is a useful assay of the ability of integrase to carry out its basic function of catalyzing polynucleotidyl transfer. The chapter concludes with the multimeric organization of HIV Integrase and HIV Integrase–DNA Interactions.},

Here, we discuss the comparison of sequence alignment techniques based on dynamic programming (N-W, S-W) and heuristics (LFASTA, BL2SEQ) for four sets of sequence          data towards an educational purpose. The analysis suggests that heuristics based methods are faster than dynamic programming methods in alignment speed.},

@article{esteHIVEntryInhibitors2007,
  abstract     = {The need for new classes of antiretroviral drugs has become apparent because of increasing concern about the long-term toxic effects of existing drugs, the need to combat HIV-1 variants that are resistant to treatment, and the frequency of treatment change in drug-experienced patients. Currently, most regimens are combinations of inhibitors of two viral enzymes—reverse transcriptase and protease. Nevertheless, several steps in the HIV replication cycle are potential targets for intervention. These steps can be divided into entry steps, in which viral envelope glycoproteins and their receptors are involved, and postentry steps, involving viral accessory gene products and the cellular proteins with which they interact. New treatment options target viral entry into the cell. These treatments include the HIV fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide, and new HIV coreceptor antagonists in advanced stages of clinical development or in different stages of preclinical development. Here, we review the development of new HIV entry inhibitors, their performance in clinical trials, and their possible role in anti-HIV therapy.},

@article{fengProgressiveSequenceAlignment1987,
  abstract     = {SummaryA progressive alignment method is described that utilizes the Needleman and Wunsch pairwise alignment algorithm iteratively to achieve the multiple alignment of a set of protein sequences and to construct an evolutionary tree depicting their relationship. The sequences are assumed a priori to share a common ancestor, and the trees are constructed from difference matrices derived directly from the multiple alignment. The thrust of the method involves putting more trust in the comparison of recently diverged sequences than in those evolved in the distant past. In particular, this rule is followed: “once a gap, always a gap”. The method has been applied to three sets of protein sequences: 7 superoxide dismutases, 11 globins, and 9 tyrosine kinase-like sequences. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees for these sets of sequences were determined and compared with trees derived by conventional pairwise treatments. In several instances, the progressive method led to trees that appeared to be more in line with biological expectations than were trees obtained by more commonly used methods.},

Recent success with antiretroviral therapy may be limited by the emergence HIV drug resistance and by toxicities and other requirements for successful long-term therapy.

  abstract   = {We address the issue of compressing and indexing data. We devise a data structure whose space occupancy is a function of the entropy of the underlying data set. We call the data structure opportunistic since its space occupancy is decreased when the input is compressible and this space reduction is achieved at no significant slowdown in the query performance. More precisely, its space occupancy is optimal in an information-content sense because text T[1,u] is stored using O(H/sub k/(T))+o(1) bits per input symbol in the worst case, where H/sub k/(T) is the kth order empirical entropy of T (the bound holds for any fixed k). Given an arbitrary string P[1,p], the opportunistic data structure allows to search for the occurrences of P in T in O(p+occlog/sup /spl epsiv//u) time (for any fixed /spl epsiv/{$>$}0). If data are uncompressible we achieve the best space bound currently known (Grossi and Vitter, 2000); on compressible data our solution improves the succinct suffix array of (Grossi and Vitter, 2000) and the classical suffix tree and suffix array data structures either in space or in query time or both. We also study our opportunistic data structure in a dynamic setting and devise a variant achieving effective search and update time bounds. Finally, we show how to plug our opportunistic data structure into the Glimpse tool (Manber and Wu, 1994). The result is an indexing tool which achieves sublinear space and sublinear query time complexity.},

What we do is reorder the computation of the usual alignment matrix so that the optimal alignment is ordinarily found when only a small fraction of the matrix is filled.

The error rate during DNA replication is as low as 10−9 to 10−11 errors per base pair. How this low level is achieved is an issue of major interest. This review is concerned with the mechanisms underlying the fidelity of the chromosomal replication in the model system Escherichia coli by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (HE), with further emphasis on participation of the other, accessory DNA polymerases, of which E. coli contains four (Pols I, II, IV, and V). Detailed genetic analysis of mutation rates revealed that (i) Pol II has an important role as a back-up proofreader for Pol III, (ii) Pols IV and V do not normally contribute significantly to replication fidelity, but can readily do so under conditions of elevated expression, (iii) participation of Pols IV and V, in contrast to that of Pol II, is specific to the lagging strand, and (iv) Pol I also makes a lagging-strand specific fidelity contribution, limited however to the faithful filling of the Okazaki fragment gaps. The fidelity role of the Pol III τ subunit is also reviewed.},

@article{fletcherEnfuvirtideNewDrug2003,
  abstract     = {We have previously reported a new class of dendrimers with tryptophan (Trp) residues on the surface that show dual antiviral activities against HIV and enterovirus EV71. The prototype compound of this family is a derivative of pentaerythritol with 12 peripheral Trp groups and trivalent spacer arms. Here a novel series of dendrimers with divalent and tetravalent branched arms, instead of the trivalent ones present on the prototype, has been synthesized and its activity against HIV, EV71 and a panel of 16 different viruses and other pathogens has been determined. Convergent or divergent approaches have been used for the synthesis of these compounds. Our findings demonstrate that only compounds with tetravalent branched arms showed the same anti-HIV and anti-EV71 activity of the prototype (low micromolar) and even gain significant antiviral activity against new pathogens such as HSV-2, adenovirus-2, human corona virus and respiratory syncytial virus, being the first members of the Trp dendrimer family that showed activity against those viruses. As the prototype, these compounds also showed low-nanomolar activity against a representative EV71 clinical isolate. Experimental work carried on to determine the mode of action of the most potent IIa, containing tetravalent branched arms, demonstrated that it interacts with the viral envelopes of HIV, EV71 and HSV-2 and thus may prevent virus attachment to the host cell. These results support the interest of this new series of Trp dendrimers and qualify them as useful prototypes for the development of novel inhibitors of viral entry with broad antiviral spectrum. The utilization of bioactive peptides in the development of highly selective and potent pharmacological agents for the disruption of protein–protein interactions is appealing for drug discovery. It is known that HIV-1 entry into a host cell is through a fusion process that is mediated by the trimeric viral glycoprotein gp120/41, which is derived from gp160 through proteolytic processing. Peptides derived from the HIV gp41 C-terminus have proven to be potent in inhibiting the fusion process. These peptides bind tightly to the hydrophobic pocket on the gp-41 N-terminus, which was previously identified as a potential inhibitor binding site. In this study, we introduce modified 23-residue C-peptides, 3 and 4, bearing a sulfono-γ-AA residue substitution and hydrocarbon stapling, respectively, which were developed for HIV-1 gp-41 N-terminus binding. Intriguingly, both 3 and 4 were capable of inhibiting envelope-mediated membrane fusion in cell–cell fusion assays at nanomolar potency. Our study reveals that sulfono-γ-AA modified peptides could be used for the development of more potent anti-HIV agents. We have recently described a new class of dendrimers with tryptophan (Trp) on the surface that show dual antiviral activities against HIV and EV71 enterovirus. The prototype compound of this family is a pentaerythritol derivative with 12 Trps on the periphery. Here we complete the structure-activity relationship studies of this family to identify key features that might be significant for the antiviral activity. With this aim, novel dendrimers containing different amino acids (aromatic and non-aromatic), tryptamine (a “decarboxylated” analogue of Trp) and N-methyl Trp on the periphery have been prepared. Dendrimer with N-Methyl Trp was the most active against HIV-1 and HIV-2 while dendrimer with tyrosine was endowed with the most potent antiviral activity against EV71. This tyrosine dendrimer proved to inhibit a large panel of EV71 clinical isolates (belonging to different clusters) in the low nanomolar/high picomolar range. In addition, a new synthetic procedure (convergent approach) has been developed for the synthesis of the prototype and some other dendrimers. This convergent approach proved more efficient (higher yields, easier purification) than the divergent approach previously reported. Dendrimers containing from 9 to 18 tryptophan residues at the peryphery have been efficiently synthesized and tested against HIV replication. These compounds inhibit an early step of the replicative cycle of HIV, presumably virus entry into its target cell. Our data suggest that HIV inhibition can be achieved by the preferred interaction of the compounds herein described with glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 of the HIV envelope preventing interaction between HIV and the (co)receptors present on the host cells. The results obtained so far indicate that 9 tryptophan residues on the periphery are sufficient for efficient gp120/gp41 binding and anti-HIV activity. Enfuvirtide (ENF) is currently the only FDA approved HIV fusion inhibitor in clinical use. Searching for more drugs in this category with higher efficacy and lower toxicity seems to be a logical next step. In line with this objective, a synthetic peptide with 36 amino acid residues, called Sifuvirtide (SFT), was designed based on the crystal structure of gp41. In this study, we show that SFT is a potent anti-HIV agent with relatively low cytotoxicity. SFT was found to inhibit replication of all tested HIV strains. The effective concentrations that inhibited 50\% viral replication (EC50), as determined in all tested strains, were either comparable or lower than benchmark values derived from well-known anti-HIV drugs like ENF or AZT, while the cytotoxic concentrations causing 50\% cell death (CC50) were relatively high, rendering it an ideal anti-HIV agent. A GST-pull down assay was performed to confirm that SFT is a fusion inhibitor. Furthermore, the activity of SFT on other targets in the HIV life cycle was also investigated, and all assays showed negative results. To further understand the mechanism of action of HIV peptide inhibitors, resistant variants of HIV-1IIIB were derived by serial virus passage in the presence of increasing doses of SFT or ENF. The results showed that there was cross-resistance between SFT and ENF. In conclusion, SFT is an ideal anti-HIV agent with high potency and low cytotoxicity, but may exhibit a certain extent of cross-resistance with ENF. The need for new classes of antiretroviral drugs has become apparent because of increasing concern about the long-term toxic effects of existing drugs, the need to combat HIV-1 variants that are resistant to treatment, and the frequency of treatment change in drug-experienced patients. Currently, most regimens are combinations of inhibitors of two viral enzymes—reverse transcriptase and protease. Nevertheless, several steps in the HIV replication cycle are potential targets for intervention. These steps can be divided into entry steps, in which viral envelope glycoproteins and their receptors are involved, and postentry steps, involving viral accessory gene products and the cellular proteins with which they interact. New treatment options target viral entry into the cell. These treatments include the HIV fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide, and new HIV coreceptor antagonists in advanced stages of clinical development or in different stages of preclinical development. Here, we review the development of new HIV entry inhibitors, their performance in clinical trials, and their possible role in anti-HIV therapy.},

@article{flynnDeepSequencingProtease2015,
  abstract     = {While the role of drug resistance mutations in HIV protease has been studied comprehensively, mutations in its substrate, Gag, have not been extensively cataloged. Using deep sequencing, we analyzed a unique collection of longitudinal viral samples from 93 patients who have been treated with therapies containing protease inhibitors (PIs). Due to the high sequence coverage within each sample, the frequencies of mutations at individual positions were calculated with high precision. We used this information to characterize the variability in the Gag polyprotein and its effects on PI-therapy outcomes. To examine covariation of mutations between two different sites using deep sequencing data, we developed an approach to estimate the tight bounds on the two-site bivariate probabilities in each viral sample, and the mutual information between pairs of positions based on all the bounds. Utilizing the new methodology we found that mutations in the matrix and p6 proteins contribute to continued therapy failure and have a major role in the network of strongly correlated mutations in the Gag polyprotein, as well as between Gag and protease. Although covariation is not direct evidence of structural propensities, we found the strongest correlations between residues on capsid and matrix of the same Gag protein were often due to structural proximity. This suggests that some of the strongest inter-protein Gag correlations are the result of structural proximity. Moreover, the strong covariation between residues in matrix and capsid at the N-terminus with p1 and p6 at the C-terminus is consistent with residue-residue contacts between these proteins at some point in the viral life cycle.},

The three current hypotheses for virus origin, e.g. the virus first, the escape and the reduction hypotheses are revisited in this new framework. Theoretical considerations suggest that RNA viruses may have originated in the nucleoprotein world by escape or reduction from RNA-cells, whereas DNA viruses (at least some of them) might have evolved directly from RNA viruses. The antiquity of viruses can explain why most viral proteins have no cellular homologues or only distantly related ones. Viral proteins have replaced the ancestral bacterial RNA/DNA polymerases and primase during mitochondrial evolution. It has been suggested that replacement of cellular proteins by viral ones also occurred in early evolution of the DNA replication apparatus and/or that some DNA replication proteins originated directly in the virosphere and were later on transferred to cellular organisms. According to these new hypotheses, viruses played a critical role in major evolutionary transitions, such as the invention of DNA and DNA replication mechanisms, the formation of the three domains of life, or else, the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus.},

To date, however, the structure of this 52-amino acid protein, by far the smallest lentiviral protein known, either in its mature form as free p6 or as the C-terminal part of the Pr55 Gag polyprotein has not been unraveled. We have explored the high resolution structure and folding of p6 by CD and NMR spectroscopy. Under membranous solution conditions, p6 can adopt a helix-flexible helix structure; a short helix-1 (amino acids 14–18) is connected to a pronounced helix-2 (amino acids 33–44) by a flexible hinge region. Thus, p6 can be subdivided into two distinct structural and functional domains; helix-2 perfectly defines the region that binds to the virus budding factor AIP-1/ALIX, indicating that this structure is required for interaction with the endosomal sorting complex required for transport. The PTAP motif at the N terminus, comprising the primary late assembly domain, which is crucial for interaction with another cellular budding factor, Tsg101, does not exhibit secondary structure. However, the adjacent helix-1 may play an indirect role in the specific complex formation between p6 and the binding groove in Tsg101. Moreover, binding studies by NMR demonstrate that helix-2, which also comprises the L\\emph\{XX\}LF motif required for incorporation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 accessory protein Vpr into budding virions, specifically interacts with the Vpr binding region, indicating that under the specific solution conditions used for structure analysis, p6 adopted a functional conformation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Although flap structures ranging from closed to semi-open are observed in the free protease, crystal structures reveal that even the semi-open flaps block access to the active site, indicating that the flaps are mobile in solution. The goals of this paper are to characterize the secondary structure and fast (sub-ns) dynamics of the flaps of the free protease in solution, to relate these results to X-ray structures and to compare them with predictions of dynamics calculations. To this end we have obtained nearly complete backbone and many sidechain signal assignments of a fully active free-protease construct that is stabilized against autoproteolysis by three point mutations. The secondary structure of this protein was characterized using the chemical shift index, measurements of 3hJNC` couplings across hydrogen bonds, and NOESY connectivities. Analysis of these measurements indicates that the protease secondary structure becomes irregular near the flap tips, residues 49–53. Model-free analysis of 15N relaxation parameters, T1, T2 (T1ρ) and 15N-\{1H\} NOE, shows that residues in the flap tips are flexible on the sub-ns time scale, in contrast with previous observations on the inhibitor-bound protease. These results are compared with theoretical predictions of flap dynamics and the possible biological significance of the sub-ns time scale dynamics of the flap tips is discussed.},

  abstract     = {The genetic architecture of common traits, including the number, frequency, and effect sizes of inherited variants that contribute to individual risk, has been long debated. Genome-wide association studies have identified scores of common variants associated with type 2 diabetes, but in aggregate, these explain only a fraction of the heritability of this disease. Here, to test the hypothesis that lower-frequency variants explain much of the remainder, the GoT2D and T2D-GENES consortia performed whole-genome sequencing in 2,657 European individuals with and without diabetes, and exome sequencing in 12,940 individuals from five ancestry groups. To increase statistical power, we expanded the sample size via genotyping and imputation in a further 111,548 subjects. Variants associated with type 2 diabetes after sequencing were overwhelmingly common and most fell within regions previously identified by genome-wide association studies. Comprehensive enumeration of sequence variation is necessary to identify functional alleles that provide important clues to disease pathophysiology, but large-scale sequencing does not support the idea that lower-frequency variants have a major role in predisposition to type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract     = {Background DNA repair is a cellular defence mechanism responding to DNA damage caused in large part by oxidative stress. There is a controversy with regard to the effect of red blood cells on DNA damage and cellular response. Aim To investigate the effect of red blood cells on H2O2-induced DNA damage and repair in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Methods DNA breaks were induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by H2O2 in the absence or presence of red blood cells, red blood cells hemolysate or hemoglobin. DNA repair was measured by 3H-thymidine uptake, \% double-stranded DNA was measured by fluorometric assay of DNA unwinding. DNA damage was measured by the comet assay and by the detection of histone H2AX phosphorylation. Results Red blood cells and red blood cells hemolysate reduced DNA repair in a dose-dependent manner. Red blood cells hemolysate reduced \% double-stranded DNA, DNA damage and phosphorylation of histone H2AX. Hemoglobin had the same effect as red blood cells hemolysate on \% double-stranded DNA. Conclusion Red blood cells, via red blood cells hemolysate and hemoglobin, reduced the effect of oxidative stress on peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA damage and phosphorylation of histone H2AX. Consequently, recruitment of DNA repair proteins diminished with reduction of DNA repair. This suggests that anemia predisposes to increased oxidative stress induced DNA damage, while a higher hemoglobin level provides protection against oxidative-stress-induced DNA damage.},

Sputnik virophages target the Mimiviridae, Mavirus was identified with the Cafeteria roenbergensis virus, and virophage genomes reconstructed by metagenomic analyses may be associated with the Phycodnaviridae. Despite the fact that the Sputnik virophages were isolated with viruses belonging to group A of the Mimiviridae, they can grow in amoebae infected by Mimiviridae from groups A, B or C. In this study we describe Zamilon, the first virophage isolated with a member of group C of the Mimiviridae family. By co-culturing amoebae with purified Zamilon, we found that the virophage is able to multiply with members of groups B and C of the Mimiviridae family but not with viruses from group A. Zamilon has a 17,276 bp DNA genome that potentially encodes 20 genes. Most of these genes are closely related to genes from the Sputnik virophage, yet two are more related to Megavirus chiliensis genes, a group B Mimiviridae, and one to Moumouvirus monve transpoviron.},

The T-cell tropism of HTLV and its prevalence in the Caribbean basin prompted a search for it in patients with the epidemic T-cell immune deficiency disorder known as AIDS. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from one patient in the United States and two in France were cultured with T-cell growth factor (TCGF) an shown to express HTLV antigens. Virus from the U.S. patient was isolated and characterized and shown to be related to HTLV subgroup I. The virus was also transmitted into normal human T cells from umbilical cord blood of a newborn. Whether or not HTLV-I or other retroviruses of this family with T-cell tropism cause AIDS, it is possible that patients from whom the virus can be isolated can also transmit it to others.

Analysis of pol, env and long terminal repeat regions revealed the presence of three highly divergent HIV-2 strains, one of which (from one of the healthy subjects) was significantly more closely related to simian immunodeficiency viruses infecting sooty mangabeys and rhesus macaques (SIVSM/SIVMAC) than to any virus of human derivation. This subject also harboured multiply defective viral genotypes that resulted from hypermutation of G to A bases. Our results indicate that HIV-2, SIVSM and SIVMAC comprise a single, highly diverse group of lentiviruses which cannot be separated into distinct phylogenetic lineages according to species of origin.},

  abstract     = {From evolutionary interference, function annotation to structural prediction, protein sequence comparison has provided crucial biological insights. While many sequence alignment algorithms have been developed, existing approaches often cannot detect hidden structural relationships in the ‘twilight zone’ of low sequence identity. To address this critical problem, we introduce a computational algorithm that performs protein Sequence Alignments from deep-Learning of Structural Alignments (SAdLSA, silent ‘d’). The key idea is to implicitly learn the protein folding code from many thousands of structural alignments using experimentally determined protein structures.To demonstrate that the folding code was learned, we first show that SAdLSA trained on pure α-helical proteins successfully recognizes pairs of structurally related pure β-sheet protein domains. Subsequent training and benchmarking on larger, highly challenging datasets show significant improvement over established approaches. For challenging cases, SAdLSA is ∼150\% better than HHsearch for generating pairwise alignments and ∼50\% better for identifying the proteins with the best alignments in a sequence library. The time complexity of SAdLSA is O(N) thanks to GPU acceleration.Datasets and source codes of SAdLSA are available free of charge for academic users at http://sites.gatech.edu/cssb/sadlsa/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract     = {The human AIDS viruses human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) represent cross-species (zoonotic) infections1,2,3,4. Although the primate reservoir of HIV-2 has been clearly identified as the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys)2,4,5,6,7, the origin of HIV-1 remains uncertain. Viruses related to HIV-1 have been isolated from the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes)8,9, but only three such SIVcpz infections have been documented1,10,11, one of which involved a virus so divergent11 that it might represent a different primate lentiviral lineage. In a search for the HIV-1 reservoir, we have now sequenced the genome of a new SIVcpz strain (SIVcpzUS) and have determined, by mitochondrial DNA analysis, the subspecies identity of all known SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees. We find that two chimpanzee subspecies in Africa, the central P. t. troglodytes  and the eastern P. t. schweinfurthii, harbour SIVcpz and that their respective viruses form two highly divergent (but subspecies-specific) phylogenetic lineages. All HIV-1 strains known to infect man, including HIV-1 groups M, N and O, are closely related to just one of these SIVcpz lineages, that found in P. t. troglodytes. Moreover, we find that HIV-1 group N is a mosaic of SIVcpzUS- and HIV-1-related sequences, indicating an ancestral recombination event in a chimpanzee host. These results, together with the observation that the natural range of P. t. troglodytes coincides uniquely with areas of HIV-1 group M, N and O endemicity, indicate that P. t. troglodytes  is the primary reservoir for HIV-1 and has been the source of at least three independent introductions of SIVcpz into the human population.},

Progressive MSA methods start by aligning the most similar sequences and subsequently incorporate the remaining sequences, from leaf to root, based on a guide tree. Their accuracy declines substantially as the number of sequences is scaled up5. We introduce a regressive algorithm that enables MSA of up to 1.4 million sequences on a standard workstation and substantially improves accuracy on datasets larger than 10,000 sequences. Our regressive algorithm works the other way around from the progressive algorithm and begins by aligning the most dissimilar sequences. It uses an efficient divide-and-conquer strategy to run third-party alignment methods in linear time, regardless of their original complexity. Our approach will enable analyses of extremely large genomic datasets such as the recently announced Earth BioGenome Project, which comprises 1.5 million eukaryotic genomes6.},

Previous studies using a limited number of clinical isolates showed that there was intrinsic variability in their susceptibility to temsavir.Here, an analysis was performed using all clinical isolates analysed in the Monogram Biosciences PhenoSense® Entry assay as part of the development programme.In total, 1337 individual envelopes encompassing 20 different HIV-1 subtypes were examined for their susceptibility to temsavir. However, only seven subtypes (B, C, F1, A, [B, F1], BF and A1) were present more than five times, with subtype B (881 isolates) and subtype C (156 isolates) having the largest numbers.As expected, variability in susceptibility was observed within all subtypes. However, for the great majority of these viruses, temsavir was highly potent, with most viruses exhibiting IC50s \&lt;10\\,nM. One exception was CRF01\_AE viruses, where all five isolates exhibited IC50s \&gt;100\\,nM. For the 607 isolates where tropism data were available, geometric mean temsavir IC50 values were remarkably similar for CCR5-, CXCR4- and dual mixed-tropic envelopes from infected individuals.These data show that HIV-1 viruses from most subtypes are highly susceptible to temsavir and that temsavir susceptibility is independent of tropism.},

  abstract     = {Supervised classification has already been the subject of numerous studies in the fields of Statistics, Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence under various appellations which include discriminant analysis, discrimination and concept learning. Many practical applications relating to this field have been developed. New methods have appeared in recent years, due to developments concerning Neural Networks and Machine Learning. These "hybrid" approaches share one common factor in that they combine symbolic and numerical aspects. The former are characterized by the representation of knowledge, the latter by the introduction of frequencies and probabilistic criteria. In the present study, we shall present a certain number of hybrid methods, conceived (or improved) by members of the SYMENU research group. These methods issue mainly from Machine Learning and from research on Classification Trees done in Statistics, and they may also be qualified as "rule-based". They shall be compared with other more classical approaches. This comparison will be based on a detailed description of each of the twelve methods envisaged, and on the results obtained concerning the "Waveform Recognition Problem" proposed by Breiman et al.,4 which is difficult for rule based approaches.},

  abstract     = {Purpose of review\~         This review highlights recent data on the pathways of resistance that impact the clinical activity of first-generation and second-generation integrase inhibitors.         Recent findings\~         Raltegravir (RAL) and elvitegravir (EVG) are highly efficacious in first-line antiretroviral therapy, with small numbers of virological failures observed in clinical trials. Durable activity in treatment-experienced patients requires a fully supportive background regimen. RAL and EVG show a low-to-moderate genetic barrier to resistance and extensive cross-resistance, which preclude their sequential use. Resistance to dolutegravir (DTG) is not selected as readily in vitro and has not emerged in studies of treatment-naïve patients to date. Both in vitro and in vivo, DTG retains activity against several RAL and EVG resistant strains, but susceptibility is variably impaired by multiple mutations within the G148 pathway, which are common after RAL or EVG failure. Cross-resistance can be partially overcome by doubling DTG dosing to twice daily, but durability of responses remains dependent on a supportive background regimen. There is variability in the integrase gene of circulating HIV strains, which does not appear to reduce drug activity, although it may influence the emergence and evolution of integrase resistance. Transmission of integrase resistance remains rare but surveillance is required.         Summary\~         Integrase inhibitors provide a potent option for the treatment of HIV infection. Drug resistance remains a challenge, which may be partially overcome by the introduction of second-generation compounds. Prompt management of RAL and EVG failure is required to prevent the accumulation of multiple resistance mutations that reduce DTG susceptibility.},

  abstract     = {Clinical studies have demonstrated that use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with or without emtricitabine as antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can decrease the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition when medication adherence is high. However, the potential for PrEP to promote antiretroviral resistance remains an important public health consideration. We performed a search of the medical literature to identify studies that address HIV drug resistance during PrEP use. In this review, we summarize findings about emergent drug resistance during clinical trials of PrEP, case reports of seroconversions in patients adherent to PrEP, and animal studies of PrEP effectiveness against drug-resistant viral strains. We also discuss the potential utility of novel PrEP formulations for protection against drug-resistant HIV, the impact of drug resistance on HIV treatment options, and mathematical models that estimate the potential contribution of PrEP to population-level drug resistance. Evidence suggests that selection for HIV drug resistance with PrEP use is infrequent and most likely to occur when PrEP is used during undiagnosed acute HIV infection. Breakthrough infections during PrEP use with high adherence are possible, but appear to be rare. The prevalence of drug-resistant HIV strains needs to be monitored as PrEP is scaled up. However, the benefit of a decreased HIV incidence with wider PrEP use is likely to outweigh the risk of harms from possible increases in the prevalence of HIV drug resistance.},

  abstract     = {From a prospective cohort study of 1948 initially human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) uninfected female commercial sex workers followed between 1985 and 1999 in Dakar, Senegal, the authors compared the male to female per infectious sexual exposure transmission probability of HIV types one (HIV-1) and two (HIV-2). New non-parametric competing risks failure time methods were used, which minimized modelling assumptions and controlled for risk factors for HIV infection. The HIV-1 versus HIV-2 infectivity ratio over time was estimated by the ratio of smoothed non-parametric kernel estimates of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection hazard functions in sex workers, adjusted by an estimate of the relative HIV-1 versus HIV-2 prevalence in the partner population. HIV-1 was found to be significantly more infectious than HIV-2 throughout the follow-up period (P {$<$} 0.001). The HIV-1/HIV-2 infectivity ratio was inferred to be approximately constant over time, with estimated common value 3.55. The finding of greater HIV-1 infectivity persisted in sensitivity analyses and in covariate-adjusted analyses, with adjusted infectivity ratio estimates ranging between 3.40 and 3.86. Understanding the mechanisms by which HIV-1 infects more efficiently than HIV-2 may be useful in the development of HIV-1 vaccines. Additionally, the methodology developed here may be useful for analysing other data sets. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We used linear support vector machines as the classifier in the tests. We also analyzed our technique by comparing some feature encoding techniques. The tests are carried out on PR-1625 and PR-3261 datasets.

  abstract     = {Objective To characterize reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations by their association with extent of nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI) therapy. To identify mutational clusters in RT sequences from persons receiving multiple NRTI. Design A total of 1210 RT sequences from persons with known antiretroviral therapy were analyzed: 641 new sequences were performed at Stanford University Hospital; 569 were previously published. Methods Chi-square tests and logistic regression were done to identify associations between mutations and NRTI therapy. Correlation studies were done to identify mutational clusters. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Results Mutations at 26 positions were significantly associated with NRTI including 17 known resistance mutations (positions 41, 44, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 74, 75, 77, 116, 118, 151, 184, 210, 215, 219) and nine previously unreported mutations (positions 20, 39, 43, 203, 208, 218, 221, 223, 228). The nine new mutations correlated linearly with number of NRTI; 777 out of 817 (95\%) instances occurred with known drug resistance mutations. Positions 203, 208, 218, 221, 223, and 228 were conserved in untreated persons; positions 20, 39, and 43 were polymorphic. Most NRTI-associated mutations clustered into three groups: (i) 62, 65, 75, 77, 115, 116, 151; (ii) 41, 43, 44, 118, 208, 210, 215, 223; (iii) 67, 69, 70, 218, 219, 228. Conclusions Mutations at nine previously unreported positions are associated with NRTI therapy. These mutations are probably accessory because they occur almost exclusively with known drug resistance mutations. Most NRTI mutations group into one of three clusters, although several (e.g., M184V) occur in multiple mutational contexts.},

Recently, a nanopore-based sequencing instrument, the Oxford Nanopore MinION, has become available, and we used this for sequencing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. To make use of these data, we developed a novel open-source hybrid error correction algorithm Nanocorr specifically for Oxford Nanopore reads, because existing packages were incapable of assembling the long read lengths (5–50 kbp) at such high error rates (between ∼5\% and 40\% error). With this new method, we were able to perform a hybrid error correction of the nanopore reads using complementary MiSeq data and produce a de novo assembly that is highly contiguous and accurate: The contig N50 length is more than ten times greater than an Illumina-only assembly (678 kb versus 59.9 kbp) and has {$>$}99.88\% consensus identity when compared to the reference. Furthermore, the assembly with the long nanopore reads presents a much more complete representation of the features of the genome and correctly assembles gene cassettes, rRNAs, transposable elements, and other genomic features that were almost entirely absent in the Illumina-only assembly.},

Here, we present amino acid substitution matrices specific for particular polar–nonpolar environment of the amino acid. As expected, these matrices [context-specific substitution matrices (CSSMs)] show striking differences from the popular BLOSUM62 matrix, which does not include structural information. When incorporated into BLAST and PSI-BLAST, CSSM outperformed BLOSUM matrices as assessed by ROC curve analyses of the number of true and false hits and by the accuracy of the sequence alignments to the hit sequences. These findings are also of relevance to profile–profile-based methods of homology detection, since CSSMs may help build a better profile. Profiles generated for protein sequences in PDB using CSSM-PSI-BLAST will be made available for searching via RPSBLAST through our web site http://lmbbi.nci.nih.gov/. Proteins 2008; 71:910–919.

@article{goonesekereFrequencyGapsObserved2004,
  abstract     = {Gap penalty is an important component of the scoring scheme that is needed when searching for homologous proteins and for accurate alignment of protein sequences. Most homology search and sequence alignment algorithms employ a heuristic ‘affine gap penalty’ scheme q+r × n, in which q is the penalty for opening a gap, r the penalty for extending it and n the gap length. In order to devise a more rational scoring scheme, we examined the pattern of gaps that occur in a database of structurally aligned protein domain pairs. We find that the logarithm of the frequency of gaps varies linearly with the length of the gap, but with a break at a gap of length 3, and is well approximated by two linear regression lines with R2 values of 1.0 and 0.99. The bilinear behavior is retained when gaps are categorized by secondary structures of the two residues flanking the gap. Similar results were obtained when another, totally independent, structurally aligned protein pair database was used. These results suggest a modification of the affine gap penalty function.},

To understand the molecular mechanisms that control the fidelity of transcription, we used novel sequencing technology to provide the first comprehensive analysis of the fidelity of transcription in eukaryotic cells. Our results demonstrate that transcription errors can occur in any gene, at any location, and affect every aspect of protein structure and function. In addition, we show that multiple proteins safeguard the fidelity of transcription and provide evidence suggesting that errors that evade these layers of RNA quality control profoundly affect the physiology of living cells. Together, these observations demonstrate that there is an inherent limit to the faithful expression of the genome and suggest that the impact of mutagenesis on cellular health and fitness is substantially greater than currently appreciated.},

@article{gregoryRegulationCellSurvival1994,
  abstract     = {Burkitt lymphoma (BL) tumour-cell populations are known to display high rates both of proliferation and of apoptosis in vivo, but the mechanisms which determine whether a BL cell continues to cycle or engages its cell-death programme are not understood. Group-I BL-derived cell lines, which retain in vitro the proliferative and apoptotic capacities of the parental cells, selectively entered apoptosis when returned to 37 degrees C after a brief period at low temperature (1 degree C). The induction of apoptosis by cold treatment, as determined by morphological characteristics and DNA fragmentation, was readily detectable within the first 1 to 2 hr of re-incubation at 37 degrees C, reaching a maximum at 4 to 6 hours. Commitment to enter apoptosis occurred after as little as 20 to 30 min at 1 degree C. Significant cell death at 1 degree C occurred only during prolonged incubation in the cold and displayed the characteristics of necrosis. Both bcl-2-dependent and -independent survival pathways were found to provide protection from cold-induced apoptosis, but only if engaged before cold-shock treatment. These results indicate that continued cycling of group-I BL cells is dependent upon their capacity to inhibit or circumvent their normally constitutively active apoptotic programme, and are consistent with the notion that the synthesis of one or more critical "survival" proteins of short half-life is necessary to guarantee successful passage through the cell cycle. Notably, high levels of apoptosis were also inducible in group-I BL cells by inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis.},

@article{guindonNewAlgorithmsMethods2010,
  abstract     = {PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early PhyML versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696–704), PhyML has been widely used (\&gt;2500 citations in ISI Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira–Hasegawa–like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The new protease inhibitors are potent inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs they may be able to cause profound and sustained suppression of HIV replication. METHODS: In this double-blind study, 97 HIV-infected patients who had received zidovudine treatment for at least 6 months and had 50 to 400 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter and at least 20,000 copies of HIV RNA per milliliter were randomly assigned to one of three treatments for up to 52 weeks: 800 mg of indinavir every eight hours; 200 mg of zidovudine every eight hours combined with 150 mg of lamivudine twice daily; or all three drugs. The patients were followed to monitor the occurrence of adverse events and changes in viral load and CD4 cell counts. RESULTS: The decrease in HIV RNA over the first 24 weeks was greater in the three-drug group than in the other groups (P{$<$}0.001 for each comparison). RNA levels decreased to less than 500 copies per milliliter at week 24 in 28 of 31 patients in the three-drug group (90 percent), 12 of 28 patients in the indinavir group (43 percent), and none of 30 patients in the zidovudine-lamivudine group. The increase in CD4 cell counts over the first 24 weeks was greater in the two groups receiving indinavir than in the zidovudine-lamivudine group (P{$<$} or =0.01 for each comparison). The changes in the viral load and the CD4 cell count persisted for up to 52 weeks. All the regimens were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In most HIV-infected patients with prior antiretroviral therapy, the combination of indinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine reduces levels of HIV RNA to less than 500 copies per milliliter for as long as one year.},

  abstract     = {Accurate predictions of protein structure properties, for example, secondary structure and solvent accessibility, are essential in analyzing the structure and function of a protein. Position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) features are widely used in the structure property prediction. However, some proteins may have low-quality PSSM features due to insufficient homologous sequences, leading to limited prediction accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose an enhancing scheme for PSSM features. We introduce the “Bagging MSA” (multiple sequence alignment) method to calculate PSSM features used to train our model, adopt a convolutional network to capture local context features and bidirectional long short-term memory for long-term dependencies, and integrate them under an unsupervised framework. Structure property prediction models are then built upon such enhanced PSSM features for more accurate predictions. Moreover, we develop two frameworks to evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced PSSM features, which also bring proposed method into real-world scenarios. Empirical evaluation of CB513, CASP11, and CASP12 data sets indicates that our unsupervised enhancing scheme indeed generates more informative PSSM features for structure property prediction.},

  abstract   = {String algorithms are a traditional area of study in computer science. In recent years their importance has grown dramatically with the huge increase of electronically stored text and of molecular sequence data (DNA or protein sequences) produced by various genome projects. This book is a general text on computer algorithms for string processing. In addition to pure computer science, the book contains extensive discussions on biological problems that are cast as string problems, and on methods developed to solve them. It emphasises the fundamental ideas and techniques central to today's applications. New approaches to this complex material simplify methods that up to now have been for the specialist alone. With over 400 exercises to reinforce the material and develop additional topics, the book is suitable as a text for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in computer science, computational biology, or bio-informatics. Its discussion of current algorithms and techniques also makes it a reference for professionals.},

@article{hacklProovreadLargescaleHighaccuracy2014,
  abstract     = {Motivation : Today, the base code of DNA is mostly determined through sequencing by synthesis as provided by the Illumina sequencers. Although highly accurate, resulting reads are short, making their analyses challenging. Recently, a new technology, single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, was developed that could address these challenges, as it generates reads of several thousand bases. But, their broad application has been hampered by a high error rate. Therefore, hybrid approaches that use high-quality short reads to correct erroneous SMRT long reads have been developed. Still, current implementations have great demands on hardware, work only in well-defined computing infrastructures and reject a substantial amount of reads. This limits their usability considerably, especially in the case of large sequencing projects. Results : Here we present proovread , a hybrid correction pipeline for SMRT reads, which can be flexibly adapted on existing hardware and infrastructure from a laptop to a high-performance computing cluster. On genomic and transcriptomic test cases covering Escherichia coli , Arabidopsis thaliana and human, proovread achieved accuracies up to 99.9\% and outperformed the existing hybrid correction programs. Furthermore, proovread -corrected sequences were longer and the throughput was higher. Thus, proovread combines the most accurate correction results with an excellent adaptability to the available hardware. It will therefore increase the applicability and value of SMRT sequencing.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the development of diagnostics using artificial intelligence (AI) has been remarkable. AI algorithms can go beyond human reasoning and build diagnostic models from a number of complex combinations. Using next-generation sequencing technology, we identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) variants resistant to directing-acting antivirals (DAA) by whole genome sequencing of full-length HCV genomes, and applied these variants to various machine-learning algorithms to evaluate a preliminary predictive model. HCV genomic RNA was extracted from serum from 173 patients (109 with subsequent sustained virological response [SVR] and 64 without) before DAA treatment. HCV genomes from the 109 SVR and 64 non-SVR patients were randomly divided into a training data set (57 SVR and 29 non-SVR) and a validation-data set (52 SVR and 35 non-SVR). The training data set was subject to nine machine-learning algorithms selected to identify the optimized combination of functional variants in relation to SVR status following DAA therapy. Subsequently, the prediction model was tested by the validation-data set. The most accurate learning method was the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm (validation accuracy, 0.95; kappa statistic, 0.90; F-value, 0.94). The second-most accurate learning algorithm was Multi-layer perceptron. Unfortunately, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes algorithms could not be fitted with our data set due to low accuracy ({$<$} 0.8). Conclusively, with an accuracy rate of 95.4\% in the generalization performance evaluation, SVM was identified as the best algorithm. Analytical methods based on genomic analysis and the construction of a predictive model by machine-learning may be applicable to the selection of the optimal treatment for other viral infections and cancer.},

@article{haghshenasLordFASTSensitiveFast2019,
  abstract     = {Motivation: Recent advances in genomics and precision medicine have been made possible through the application of high throughput sequencing (HTS) to large collections of human genomes. Although HTS technologies have proven their use in cataloging human genome variation, computational analysis of the data they generate is still far from being perfect. The main limitation of Illumina and other popular sequencing technologies is their short read length relative to the lengths of (common) genomic repeats. Newer (single molecule sequencing - SMS) technologies such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore are producing longer reads, making it theoretically possible to overcome the difficulties imposed by repeat regions. Unfortunately, because of their high sequencing error rate, reads generated by these technologies are very difficult to work with and cannot be used in many of the standard downstream analysis pipelines. Note that it is not only difficult to find the correct mapping locations of such reads in a reference genome, but also to establish their correct alignment so as to differentiate sequencing errors from real genomic variants. Furthermore, especially since newer SMS instruments provide higher throughput, mapping and alignment need to be performed much faster than before, maintaining high sensitivity. Results: We introduce lordFAST, a novel long-read mapper that is specifically designed to align reads generated by PacBio and potentially other SMS technologies to a reference. lordFAST not only has higher sensitivity than the available alternatives, it is also among the fastest and has a very low memory footprint. Availability and implementation: lordFAST is implemented in C++ and supports multi-threading. The source code of lordFAST is available at https://github.com/vpc-ccg/lordfast.

Prevalence and incidence rates for HIV-1 and HIV-2 are described from 290 seroprevalent and 193 seroincident subjects who were among the 3,910 women enrolled between 1985 and 2004. We report a significant decrease of HIV-2 prevalence in the cohort, parallel to the introduction and rise of HIV-1 infection. In 328 HIV-1-infected women, a 385-bp C2-V3 fragment of the envelope gene was sequenced and classified into the following subtypes or recombinant forms: 239 (72\%) were subtype A [of which 180 (55\%) were CRF02\_AG and 53 (16\%) were A3], 10 (3\%) were B, 12 (4\%) were C, 11 (4\%) were D, 18 (6\%) were G, 24 (7\%) were CRF06\_cpx, and 7 (2\%) were CRF09\_cpx. We found an increasing proportion of CRF02\_AG over many years, but recently subsubtype A3 has over-taken CRF02\_AG, with the largest proportion of new infections. The predominance of existing HIV-1 subtypes did not preclude the emergence and increase of other closely related subtypes or recombinant forms. This 20-year prospective serological and sequence analysis of HIV viruses reveals a complex and changing HIV epidemic in Senegal.},

In contrast to previously described preparations, the RNA cleavage activity of the untagged RNase H domain was surprisingly similar to that of the full-length HIV-RT protein. Signature cleavages at 18 and 9 nucleotides downstream of a recessed RNA 5′-end were retained with the isolated RNase H domain. Activity was strongly decreased by deletion of 3 amino acids from the C-terminus, consistent with an important structural or functional role of the C-terminal α-helix. A prototype N-hydroxyimide (2-hydroxy-4H-isoquinoline-1,3-dione) was found to inhibit the activity of the isolated HIV RNase H domain as well as the RNase H activity of full-length HIV reverse transcriptase. In contrast, the compound did not significantly inhibit the structurally closely related Escherichia coli RNase HI. Specific binding of N-hydroxyimide compounds to the isolated RNase H domain was observed by protein fluorescence quenching.},

  abstract      = {For testing independence it is very popular to use either the \$\\textbackslash chi\^\{2\}\$-statistic or \$G\^\{2\}\$-statistics (mutual information). Asymptotically both are \$\\textbackslash chi\^\{2\}\$-distributed so an obvious question is which of the two statistics that has a distribution that is closest to the \$\\textbackslash chi\^\{2\}\$-distribution. Surprisingly the distribution of mutual information is much better approximated by a \$\\textbackslash chi\^\{2\}\$-distribution than the \$\\textbackslash chi\^\{2\}\$-statistic. For technical reasons we shall focus on the simplest case with one degree of freedom. We introduce the signed log-likelihood and demonstrate that its distribution function can be related to the distribution function of a standard Gaussian by inequalities. For the hypergeometric distribution we formulate a general conjecture about how close the signed log-likelihood is to a standard Gaussian, and this conjecture gives much more accurate estimates of the tail probabilities of this type of distribution than previously published results. The conjecture has been proved numerically in all cases relevant for testing independence and further evidence of its validity is given.},

@book{hastieElementsStatisticalLearning2009,
  abstract    = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

  abstract     = {The development of next-generation sequencing instruments has led to the generation of millions of short sequences in a single run. The process of aligning these reads to a reference genome is time consuming and demands the development of fast and accurate alignment tools. However, the current proposed tools make different compromises between the accuracy and the speed of mapping. Moreover, many important aspects are overlooked while comparing the performance of a newly developed tool to the state of the art. Therefore, there is a need for an objective evaluation method that covers all the aspects. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking suite to extensively analyze sequencing tools with respect to various aspects and provide an objective comparison.},

@article{heiderMultilabelClassificationExploiting2013,
  abstract     = {Motivation: Antiretroviral treatment regimens can sufficiently suppress viral replication in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and prevent the progression of the disease. However, one of the factors contributing to the progression of the disease despite ongoing antiretroviral treatment is the emergence of drug resistance. The high mutation rate of HIV can lead to a fast adaptation of the virus under drug pressure, thus to failure of antiretroviral treatment due to the evolution of drug-resistant variants. Moreover, cross-resistance phenomena have been frequently found in HIV-1, leading to resistance not only against a drug from the current treatment, but also to other not yet applied drugs. Automatic classification and prediction of drug resistance is increasingly important in HIV research as well as in clinical settings, and to this end, machine learning techniques have been widely applied. Nevertheless, cross-resistance information was not taken explicitly into account, yet.Results: In our study, we demonstrated the use of cross-resistance information to predict drug resistance in HIV-1. We tested a set of more than 600 reverse transcriptase sequences and corresponding resistance information for six nucleoside analogues. Based on multilabel classification models and cross-resistance information, we were able to significantly improve overall prediction accuracy for all drugs, compared with single binary classifiers without any additional information. Moreover, we identified drug-specific patterns within the reverse transcriptase sequences that can be used to determine an optimal order of the classifiers within the classifier chains. These patterns are in good agreement with known resistance mutations and support the use of cross-resistance information in such prediction models.Contact:dominik.heider@uni-due.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{heilek-snyderRoleHIVPhenotypic2002,
  abstract     = {Contemporary phenotypic assays such as the PhenoSense HIV assay are more straightforward to interpret than genotyping results because they do not require the expert interpretation of complex mutation patterns. The drug susceptibility data provides information for the clinician to select a treatment regimen effective against the predominant viral population circulating in the patient's blood. Compared to traditional phenotypic assays, the PhenoSense HIV assay uses a virus vector and a luciferase reporter gene to provide a quick and sensitive measure of viral replication. The main use of phenotypic assays at present is to identify those antiretroviral drugs that still retain activity against the patient's virus. Phenotypic assays are useful to provide guidance after treatment failure and to select a proper combination of drugs prior to initiation of therapy. They are also useful to detect transmission of resistance virus and to monitor HIV patients during early viral rebound. In essence, phenotypic testing provides information to target antiretroviral therapy against the predominant HIV variant in the patient for a prolonged suppression of viral replication, decreased mortality, and lower health-care costs.},

  abstract     = {Objective To estimate the global and regional distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants between 2000 and 2007. Design Country-specific HIV-1 molecular epidemiology data were combined with estimates of the number of HIV-infected people in each country. Method Cross-sectional HIV-1 subtyping data were collected from 65913 samples in 109 countries between 2000 and 2007. The distribution of HIV-1 subtypes in individual countries was weighted according to the number of HIV-infected people in each country to generate estimates of regional and global HIV-1 subtype distribution for the periods 2000–2003 and 2004–2007. Results Analysis of the global distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants in the two time periods indicated a broadly stable distribution of HIV-1 subtypes worldwide with a notable increase in the proportion of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), a decrease in unique recombinant forms (URFs), and an overall increase in recombinants. In 2004–2007, subtype C accounted for nearly half (48\%) of all global infections, followed by subtypes A (12\%) and B (11\%), CRF02\_AG (8\%), CRF01\_AE (5\%), subtype G (5\%) and D(2\%). Subtypes F, H, J and K together cause fewer than 1\% of infections worldwide. Other CRFs and URFs are each responsible for 4\% of global infections, bringing the combined total of worldwide CRFs to 16\% and all recombinants (CRFs plus URFs) to 20\%. Conclusions The global and regional distributions of individual subtypes and recombinants are broadly stable, although CRFs may play an increasing role in the HIV pandemic. The global diversity of HIV-1 poses a formidable challenge to HIV vaccine development.},

Previous attempts to predict the evolution of protein sequences have been limited to specific proteins and to small changes, such as single-residue mutations. Here, we demonstrate that by using a protein language model to predict the local evolution within protein families, we recover a dynamic “vector field” of protein evolution that we call evolutionary velocity (evo-velocity). Evo-velocity generalizes to evolution over vastly different timescales, from viral proteins evolving over years to eukaryotic proteins evolving over geologic eons, and can predict the evolutionary dynamics of proteins that were not used to develop the original model. Evo-velocity also yields new evolutionary insights by predicting strategies of viral-host immune escape, resolving conflicting theories on the evolution of serpins, and revealing a key role of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of eukaryotic glycolysis.},

Thus, macaques may have acquired SIV in captivity by cross-species transmission from an SIV-infected African primate. Sooty mangabeys (Cercocebm atys), an African primate species indigenous to West Africa, however, are infected with SIV (SIVsm) both in captivity9–11and in the wild (P. Fultz, personal communication).

  abstract     = {HIV invasion through the mucosa of the female lower genital tract contributes the largest number of new HIV infections worldwide. The second leading site of viral invasion is the lower male genital tract, followed by invasion via the rectal mucosa in both women and men.Models of explanted human genital tissues have provided new insights into the mechanisms of sexual HIV transmission.Initial attachment of HIV-1 to the mucosa may be aided by cervical mucus and various gp120-binding surface receptors on epithelial cells. HIV-1 penetration into the genital mucosa occurs rapidly after exposure and is possibly enhanced by micro-abrasions or genital ulcer disease.In the human vagina, intraepithelial CD4+ T cells and CD1a+ Langerhans cells are the first cells infected by HIV-1.Vaginal Langerhans cells exhibit a high capacity to endocytose HIV-1 virions. C-type lectins such as dendritic-cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN; also known as CD209) or langerin (also known as CD207) appear to have little or no role in mediating this infection pathway.Genital CD4+ T cells express high levels of CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) are rapidly infected by HIV-1 and produce large quantities of viral progeny.In vitro studies have shown that dendritic cells use several pathways to enhance viral propagation to CD4+ T cells for productive infection. Presumably these also occur in the genital mucosa, but direct evidence is lacking.The highly protective effect of circumcision indicates that viral invasion in men occurs predominantly through the inner foreskin, where both CD1a+ Langerhans cells and CD4+ T cells are abundant. The second leading site of viral invasion in the male genital tract is probably the penile urethra.},

In most scenarios, having the minimizer scheme select as few k-mer positions as possible (i.e., having a low density) is desirable to reduce computation and memory cost. Despite the growing interest in minimizers, learning an effective scheme with optimal density is still an open question, as it requires solving an apparently challenging discrete optimization problem on the permutation space of k-mer orderings. Most existing schemes are designed to work well in expectation over random sequences, which have limited applicability to many practical tools. On the other hand, several methods have been proposed to construct minimizer schemes for a specific target sequence. These methods, however, only approximate the original objective with likewise discrete surrogate tasks that are not able to significantly improve the density performance. This article introduces the first continuous relaxation of the density minimizing objective, DeepMinimizer, which employs a novel Deep Learning twin architecture to simultaneously ensure both validity and performance of the minimizer scheme. Our surrogate objective is fully differentiable and, therefore, amenable to efficient gradient-based optimization using GPU computing. Finally, we demonstrate that DeepMinimizer discovers minimizer schemes that significantly outperform state-of-the-art constructions on human genomic sequences.},

Genomics data analytics at this scale requires overcoming performance bottlenecks, such as searching for short DNA sequences over long reference sequences. Results In this paper, we introduce LISA (Learned Indexes for Sequence Analysis), a novel learning-based approach to DNA sequence search. We focus on accelerating two of the most essential flavors of DNA sequence search—exact search and super-maximal exact match (SMEM) search. LISA builds on and extends FM-index, which is the state-of-the-art technique widely deployed in genomics tools. Experiments with human, animal, and plant genome datasets indicate that LISA achieves up to 2.2 and 10.8 speedups over the state-of-the-art FM-index based implementations for exact search and super-maximal exact match (SMEM) search, respectively.

Given the variability in SV type and size, along with unique detection biases of emerging genomic platforms, multiplatform discovery is necessary to resolve the full spectrum of variation.

@article{hueDemonstrationSustainedDrugResistant2009,
  abstract     = {Transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance is well-recognized and compromises response to first-line therapy. However, the population dynamics of transmitted resistance remains unclear, although previous models have assumed that such transmission reflects direct infection from treated individuals. We investigated whether population-based phylogenetic analyses would uncover lineages of resistant viruses circulating in untreated individuals. Through the phylogenetic analysis of 14,061 HIV type 1 (HIV-1) pol gene sequences generated in the United Kingdom from both treatment-naïve and -experienced individuals, we identified five treatment-independent viral clusters containing mutations conferring cross-resistance to antiretroviral drugs prescribed today in the United Kingdom. These viral lineages represent sustainable reservoirs of resistance among new HIV infections, independent of treatment. Dated phylogenies reconstructed through Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo inference indicated that these reservoirs originated between 1997 and 2003 and have persisted in the HIV-infected population for up to 8 years. Since our cohort does not represent all infected individuals within the United Kingdom, our results are likely to underestimate the number and size of the resistant reservoirs circulating among drug-naïve patients. The existence of sustained reservoirs of resistance in the absence of treatment has the capacity to threaten the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral therapy and suggests there is a limit to the decline of transmitted drug resistance. Given the current decrease in resistance transmitted from treated individuals, a greater proportion of resistance is likely to come from drug-naïve lineages. These findings provide new insights for the planning and management of treatment programs in resource-rich and developing countries.},

In this paper, we investigate the representation ability of three popular PLMs: ESM-1b (single sequence), MSA-Transformer (multiple sequence alignment) and Evoformer (structural), with a special focus on Evoformer. Specifically, we aim to answer the following key questions: (i) Does the Evoformer trained as part of AlphaFold produce representations amenable to predicting protein function? (ii) If yes, can Evoformer replace ESM-1b and MSA-Transformer? (iii) How much do these PLMs rely on evolution-related protein data? In this regard, are they complementary to each other? We compare these models by empirical study along with new insights and conclusions. Finally, we release code and datasets for reproducibility.},

The hepatitis D virion is composed of a coat of HBV envelope proteins surrounding the nucleocapsid, which consists of a single-stranded, circular RNA genome complexed with delta antigen, the viral protein. HDV is clinically important because although it suppresses HBV replication, it causes severe liver disease with rapid progression to cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation. The range of clinical presentation is wide, varying from mild disease to fulminant liver failure. The prevalence of HDV is declining in some endemic areas but increasing in northern and central Europe because of immigration. Treatment of HDV is with pegylated interferon alfa; however, response rates are poor. Increased understanding of the molecular virology of HDV will identify novel therapeutic targets for this most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis.},

This new method of transcriptome sequencing has been applied to several projects on humans and model organisms. However, the raw data from SMRT sequencing are of relatively low quality, with a random error rate of approximately 15\~\%, for which error correction using next-generation sequencing (NGS) short reads is typically necessary. Few tools have been designed that apply a hybrid sequencing approach that combines NGS and SMRT data, and the most popular existing tool for error correction, LSC, has computing resource requirements that are too intensive for most laboratory and research groups. These shortcomings severely limit the application of SMRT long reads for transcriptome analysis.},

These successes were buoyed by additional positive results from the TDF2 and Partners PrEP trials. Although no seroconverters in either arm of CAPRISA developed resistance to tenofovir, 2 participants in iPrEx with undetected, seronegative acute HIV infection were randomized to receive daily oral tenofovir-emtricitabine and resistance to emtricitabine was later discovered in both men. A similar case in the TDF2 study resulted in resistance to both ARVs. These cases prompted us to examine existing literature on the nature of resistance mutations elicited by ARVs used for PrEP. Here, we discuss the impact of signature mutations selected by PrEP, how rapidly these emerge with daily ARV exposure, and the individual-level and public health consequences of ARV resistance.},

  abstract     = {The sequence of the human genome encodes the genetic instructions for human physiology, as well as rich information about human evolution. In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers ∼99\% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of ∼1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000–25,000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead.},

To overcome long execution times for simulated annealing, we utilized a parallel computer. A sequential algorithm, a simple parallel algorithm and the temperature parallel algorithm were tested on a problem. The results were compared with the result obtained by a conventional tree-based algorithm where alignments were merged by two-' dynamic programming. Every annealing algorithm produced a better energy value than the conventional algorithm. The best energy value, which probably represents the optimal solution, wns reached within a reasonable time by both of the parallel annealing algorithms. We consider the temperature parallel algorithm of simulated annealing to be the most suitable for finding the optimal multiple sequence alignment because the algorithm does not require any scheduling for optimization. The algorithm is also usefiui for refining multiple alignments obtained by other hewistic methods.},

@article{jainFastAdaptiveAlgorithm2018,
  abstract     = {Whole-genome alignment is an important problem in genomics for comparing different species, mapping draft assemblies to reference genomes and identifying repeats. However, for large plant and animal genomes, this task remains compute and memory intensive. In addition, current practical methods lack any guarantee on the characteristics of output alignments, thus making them hard to tune for different application requirements.We introduce an approximate algorithm for computing local alignment boundaries between long DNA sequences. Given a minimum alignment length and an identity threshold, our algorithm computes the desired alignment boundaries and identity estimates using kmer-based statistics, and maintains sufficient probabilistic guarantees on the output sensitivity. Further, to prioritize higher scoring alignment intervals, we develop a plane-sweep based filtering technique which is theoretically optimal and practically efficient. Implementation of these ideas resulted in a fast and accurate assembly-to-genome and genome-to-genome mapper. As a result, we were able to map an error-corrected whole-genome NA12878 human assembly to the hg38 human reference genome in about 1\\,min total execution time and \&lt;4 GB memory using eight CPU threads, achieving significant improvement in memory-usage over competing methods. Recall accuracy of computed alignment boundaries was consistently found to be \&gt;97\% on multiple datasets. Finally, we performed a sensitive self-alignment of the human genome to compute all duplications of length ≥1 Kbp and ≥90\% identity. The reported output achieves good recall and covers twice the number of bases than the current UCSC browser’s segmental duplication annotation.https://github.com/marbl/MashMap},

In this article, we combine a fast approximate read mapping algorithm based on minimizers with a novel MinHash identity estimation technique to achieve both scalability and precision. In contrast to prior methods, we develop a mathematical framework that defines the types of mapping targets we uncover, establish probabilistic estimates of p-value and sensitivity, and demonstrate tolerance for alignment error rates up to 20\%. With this framework, our algorithm automatically adapts to different minimum length and identity requirements and provides both positional and identity estimates for each mapping reported. For mapping human PacBio reads to the hg38 reference, our method is 290\\,× \\,faster than Burrows–Wheeler Aligner-MEM with a lower memory footprint and recall rate of 96\%.

We show that existing long-read mappers often yield incorrect alignments and variant calls within long, near-identical repeats, as they remain vulnerable to allelic bias. In the presence of a nonreference allele within a repeat, a read sampled from that region could be mapped to an incorrect repeat copy. To address this limitation, we developed a new long-read mapping method, Winnowmap2, by using minimal confidently alignable substrings. Winnowmap2 computes each read mapping through a collection of confident subalignments. This approach is more tolerant of structural variation and more sensitive to paralog-specific variants within repeats. Our experiments highlight that Winnowmap2 successfully addresses the issue of allelic bias, enabling more accurate downstream variant calls in repetitive sequences.},

@article{jainWeightedMinimizerSampling2020,
  abstract     = {In this era of exponential data growth, minimizer sampling has become a standard algorithmic technique for rapid genome sequence comparison. This technique yields a sub-linear representation of sequences, enabling their comparison in reduced space and time. A key property of the minimizer technique is that if two sequences share a substring of a specified length, then they can be guaranteed to have a matching minimizer. However, because the k-mer distribution in eukaryotic genomes is highly uneven, minimizer-based tools (e.g. Minimap2, Mashmap) opt to discard the most frequently occurring minimizers from the genome to avoid excessive false positives. By doing so, the underlying guarantee is lost and accuracy is reduced in repetitive genomic regions.We introduce a novel weighted-minimizer sampling algorithm. A unique feature of the proposed algorithm is that it performs minimizer sampling while considering a weight for each k-mer; i.e. the higher the weight of a k-mer, the more likely it is to be selected. By down-weighting frequently occurring k-mers, we are able to meet both objectives: (i) avoid excessive false-positive matches and (ii) maintain the minimizer match guarantee. We tested our algorithm, Winnowmap, using both simulated and real long-read data and compared it to a state-of-the-art long read mapper, Minimap2. Our results demonstrate a reduction in the mapping error-rate from 0.14\% to 0.06\% in the recently finished human X chromosome (154.3 Mbp), and from 3.6\% to 0\% within the highly repetitive X centromere (3.1 Mbp). Winnowmap improves mapping accuracy within repeats and achieves these results with sparser sampling, leading to better index compression and competitive runtimes. Winnowmap is built on top of the Minimap2 codebase and is available at https://github.com/marbl/winnowmap.},

@article{jiDNABERTPretrainedBidirectional2021,
  abstract     = {Deciphering the language of non-coding DNA is one of the fundamental problems in genome research. Gene regulatory code is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios.To address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation, named DNABERT, to capture global and transferrable understanding of genomic DNA sequences based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared DNABERT to the most widely used programs for genome-wide regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use, accuracy and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites and transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using small task-specific labeled data. Further, DNABERT enables direct visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic relationship within input sequences for better interpretability and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-trained DNABERT with human genome can even be readily applied to other organisms with exceptional performance. We anticipate that the pre-trained DNABERT model can be fined tuned to many other sequence analyses tasks.The source code, pretrained and finetuned model for DNABERT are available at GitHub (https://github.com/jerryji1993/DNABERT).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Using a new testing set based on a set of 187 unique folds, and three-way cross-validation based on structural similarity criteria rather than sequence similarity criteria used previously (no similar folds were present in both the testing and training sets) the method presented here (PSIPRED) achieved an average Q3 score of between 76.5\% to 78.3\% depending on the precise definition of observed secondary structure used, which is the highest published score for any method to date. Given the success of the method in CASP3, it is reasonable to be confident that the evaluation presented here gives a fair indication of the performance of the method in general.},

The closest relating pairs of sequences are aligned, and observed amino acid exchanges tallied in a matrix. The raw mutation frequency matrix is processed in a similar way to that described by Dayhoffet al. (1978), and so the resulting matrices may be easily used in current sequence analysis applications, in place of the standard mutation data matrices, which have not been updated for 13 years. The method is fast enough to process the entire SWISS-PROT databank in 20 h on a Sun SPARCstation 1, and is fast enough to generate a matrix from a specific family or class of proteins in minutes. Differences observed between our 250 PAM mutation data matrix and the matrix calculated by Dayhoff et al. are briefly discussed.},

  abstract     = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50\~years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far\~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

The key challenge in the seeding phase is searching for exact matches of substrings of short reads in the reference DNA sequence. Existing algorithms, however, present limitations in performance due to their frequent memory accesses.This article presents BWA-MEME, the first full-fledged short read alignment software that leverages learned indices for solving the exact match search problem for efficient seeding. BWA-MEME is a practical and efficient seeding algorithm based on a suffix array search algorithm that solves the challenges in utilizing learned indices for SMEM search which is extensively used in the seeding phase. Our evaluation shows that BWA-MEME achieves up to 3.45× speedup in seeding throughput over BWA-MEM2 by reducing the number of instructions by 4.60×, memory accesses by 8.77× and LLC misses by 2.21×, while ensuring the identical SAM output to BWA-MEM2.The source code and test scripts are available for academic use at https://github.com/kaist-ina/BWA-MEME/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

(i) Homo logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to a sequence composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method (FFT‐NS‐2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT‐NS‐i), are implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT‐NS‐2 and FFT‐NS‐i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT‐NS‐2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT‐NS‐i is over 100 times faster than T‐COFFEE, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

The new MSA method with the PartTree algorithm can align ∼60\\,000 sequences in several minutes on a standard desktop computer.

  abstract     = {Objective:\~         To evaluate phenotypic drug susceptibility and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor hypersusceptibility as predictors of the time to virological failure.         Design:\~         In a randomized clinical trial, phenotypic susceptibility was retrospectively determined among 131 exclusively nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-experienced patients with baseline HIV-RNA levels greater than 2000 copies/ml. Subjects were assigned two NRTI drugs and were randomly assigned to nelfinavir, efavirenz, or both. Virological failure was defined as two HIV-RNA measurements of 2000 copies/ml or greater at or after week 16 and before treatment discontinuation.         Methods:\~         Using biological cut-offs to define resistance, assigned NRTI and randomized drug regimens, continuous and dichotomous phenotypic susceptibility scores (PSS) were calculated for each virus. Efavirenz hypersusceptibility as a dichotomous value was defined as less than 0.4-fold resistance. Associations between virological failure and continuous and dichotomous PSS were evaluated using Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models.         Results:\~         A higher baseline viral load (P {$<$} 0.02) and lower dichotomous or continuous baseline PSS (P = 0.004 and P {$<$} 0.001, respectively) were independently associated with virological failure. In the 85 subjects who received efavirenz, efavirenz hypersusceptibility (P = 0.042, hazard ratio 0.43, 95\% confidence interval 0.19–0.97) was independently associated with a reduced risk of virological failure.         Conclusion:\~         Reduced phenotypic susceptibility was a significant independent risk factor for virological failure. The presence of efavirenz hypersusceptibility appeared to enhance virological responses during treatment with efavirenz in combination with NRTIs. The retrospective calculation of continuous PSS accurately identified treatment regimens containing sufficient drug activity to prevent virological failure.},

@inproceedings{kaufmanLeakageDataMining2011,
  abstract   = {Deemed "one of the top ten data mining mistakes", leakage is essentially the introduction of information about the data mining target, which should not be legitimately available to mine from. In addition to our own industry experience with real-life projects, controversies around several major public data mining competitions held recently such as the INFORMS 2010 Data Mining Challenge and the IJCNN 2011 Social Network Challenge are evidence that this issue is as relevant today as it has ever been. While acknowledging the importance and prevalence of leakage in both synthetic competitions and real-life data mining projects, existing literature has largely left this idea unexplored. What little has been said turns out not to be broad enough to cover more complex cases of leakage, such as those where the classical i.i.d. assumption is violated, that have been recently documented. In our new approach, these cases and others are explained by explicitly defining modeling goals and analyzing the broader framework of the data mining problem. The resulting definition enables us to derive general methodology for dealing with the issue. We show that it is possible to avoid leakage with a simple specific approach to data management followed by what we call a learn-predict separation, and present several ways of detecting leakage when the modeler has no control over how the data have been collected.},

Despite the importance suggested by many noncoding variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanisms. Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on a recent machine learning advance—deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.},

Vpu is an HIV-1 accessory protein generated from Env/Vpu encoded bicistronic mRNA and localized in cytosolic and membrane regions of cells capable of being infected by HIV-1 and that regulate HIV-1 infection and transmission by downregulating BST-2, CD4 proteins levels, and immune evasion. This review will focus of critical aspects of Vpu including its zoonosis, the adaptive hurdles to cross-species transmission, and future perspectives and broad implications of Vpu in HIV-1 infection and dissemination.},

@incollection{kieferEffectsUltravioletRadiation2007,
  abstract  = {UV radiation is selectively absorbed by DNA, mainly in the UV-B and the UV-C regions. Excitation of DNA leads to typical photoproducts, the most important being pyrimidine dimers and the so-called 6-4-photoproduct. The yield of strand breaks is very low directly after exposure, but they may be formed indirectly upon further incubation. Although DNA absorbs only weakly in the UV-A region, it may be damaged indirectly via endogenous photosensitisers. Photoproducts are subject to repair processes which are genetically determined. Photoreactivation splits selectively pyrimidine dimers but it is limited to lower eukaryotes and does not occur in mammalian cells. Nucleotide excision repair acts on various types of damage. UVinduced damage manifests itself also at the level of chromosomes. Chromatid-type aberrations are more frequent with UV irradiation than chromosomal aberrations. The action spectrum for their formation demonstrates that an indirect mechanism plays an important role in the UV-A region. Also micronuclei are found after broadband UV exposure which are presumably due to indirectly formed double-strand breaks. UV radiation is a strong inducer of sister-chromatid exchanges, in contrast to ionising radiation, where the yields are low. This suggests that strand breaks play only a minor role.},

  abstract     = {Multiple sequence alignment is a useful technique for studying molecular evolution and analyzing structure-sequence relationships. Dynamic programming of multiple sequence alignment has been widely used to find an optimal alignment. However, dynamic programming does not allow for certain types of gap costs, and it limits the number of sequences that can be aligned due to its high computational complexity. The focus of this paper is to use simulated annealing as the basis for developing an efficient multiple sequence alignment algorithm. An algorithm called Multiple Sequence Alignment using Simulated Annealing (MSASA) has been developed. The computational complexity of MSASA is significantly reduced by replacing the high-temperature phase of the annealing process by a fast heuristic algorithm. This heuristic algorithm facilitates in minimizing the solution set of the low-temperature phase of the annealing process. Compared to the dynamic programming approach, MSASA can (i) use natural gap costs which can generate better solution, (ii) align more sequences and (iii) take less computation time.},

Embedding a biological sequence over a nucleotide or amino acid alphabet in a lower dimensional vector space makes the data more amenable for use by current machine learning tools, provided the quality of embedding is high and it captures the most meaningful information of the original sequences. Motivated by recent advances in the text document embedding literature, we present a new method, called seq2vec, to represent a complete biological sequence in an Euclidean space.

  abstract      = {Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O(\$L\^2\$) to O(\$L\\textbackslash log L\$), where \$L\$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of \$N\$ times, where \$N\$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.},

@article{klumppRecentProgressDesign2006,
  abstract     = {DNA polymerase and RNase H (RH) activities of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) have been recognized as potential targets for antiretroviral therapy for more than 15 years. The development of medicines targeting the DNA polymerase activity has been highly successful, with currently 12 drugs approved for the treatment of HIV infection and more candidates in preclinical and clinical development. In contrast, the discovery of potent and selective inhibitors of HIV RH has been slow, and inhibitors of this enzyme function have yet to reach the clinical development stage. Selective HIV RH inhibitors are likely to provide significant clinical benefit in combination therapies, considering the high prevalence of HIV strains resistant to currently available antiretroviral therapies. Recent progress in a number of key areas has provided new impetus to the discovery of HIV RH inhibitors. High throughput assay systems based on fluorescence detection have been developed, which facilitate screening of inhibitor candidates. Substantial progress has been made in expression, purification, crystallisation and solution studies of HIV RT and RH, in particular with regards to aspects of structural dynamics. Crystal structures of active site binding and allosteric HIV RH inhibitors bound to HIV RT and RH have been obtained. Finally, an improved understanding of similarities and differences in enzymatic mechanisms between related nuclease enzymes has provided new concepts for achieving inhibitor selectivity. Together, these developments provide promising new starting points for the rational design of selective HIV RH inhibitors.},

@article{koboldtBestPracticesVariant2020,
  abstract     = {Next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled a dramatic expansion of clinical genetic testing both for inherited conditions and diseases such as cancer. Accurate variant calling in NGS data is a critical step upon which virtually all downstream analysis and interpretation processes rely. Just as NGS technologies have evolved considerably over the past 10\~years, so too have the software tools and approaches for detecting sequence variants in clinical samples. In this review, I discuss the current best practices for variant calling in clinical sequencing studies, with a particular emphasis on trio sequencing for inherited disorders and somatic mutation detection in cancer patients. I describe the relative strengths and weaknesses of panel, exome, and whole-genome sequencing for variant detection. Recommended tools and strategies for calling variants of different classes are also provided, along with guidance on variant review, validation, and benchmarking to ensure optimal performance. Although NGS technologies are continually evolving, and new capabilities (such as long-read single-molecule sequencing) are emerging, the “best practice” principles in this review should be relevant to clinical variant calling in the long term.},

@article{konishiPrincipalComponentAnalysis2019,
  abstract     = {Sequence data is now widely used to observe relationships among organisms. However, understanding structure of the qualitative data is challenging. Conventionally, the relationships are analysed using a dendrogram that estimates a tree shape. This approach has difficulty in verifying the appropriateness of the tree shape; rather, horizontal gene transfers and mating can make the shape of the relationship as networks. As a connection-free approach, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to summarize the distance matrix, which records distances between each combination of samples. However, this approach is limited regarding the treatment of information of sequence motifs; distances caused by different motifs are mixed up. This hides clues to figure out how the samples are different. As any bases may change independently, a sequence is multivariate data essentially. Hence, differences among samples and bases that contribute to the difference should be observed coincidentally. To archive this, the sequence matrix is transferred to boolean vector and directly analysed by using PCA. The effects are confirmed in diversity of Asiatic lion and human as well as environmental DNA. Resolution of samples and robustness of calculation is improved. Relationship of a direction of difference and causative nucleotides has become obvious at a glance.},

Using parallel supercomputers and assuming a constant rate of evolution, we applied maximum-likelihood phylogenetic methods to unprecedented amounts of data for this calculation. We validated our approach by correctly estimating the timing of two historically documented points. Using a comprehensive full-length envelope sequence alignment, we estimated the date of the last common ancestor of the main group of HIV-1 to be 1931 (1915-41). Analysis of a gag gene alignment, subregions of envelope including additional sequences, and a method that relaxed the assumption of a strict molecular clock also supported these results.},

@article{korenCanuScalableAccurate2017,
  abstract     = {Long-read single-molecule sequencing has revolutionized de novo genome assembly and enabled the automated reconstruction of reference-quality genomes. However, given the relatively high error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate assembly of large repeats and closely related haplotypes remains challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a successor of Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage requirements, and improves assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an order of magnitude on large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2. These advances result from new overlapping and assembly algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based on tf-idf weighted MinHash and a sparse assembly graph construction that avoids collapsing diverged repeats and haplotypes. We demonstrate that Canu can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and near-complete eukaryotic chromosomes using either Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore technologies and achieves a contig NG50 of {$>$}21 Mbp on both human and Drosophila melanogaster PacBio data sets. For assembly structures that cannot be linearly represented, Canu provides graph-based assembly outputs in graphical fragment assembly (GFA) format for analysis or integration with complementary phasing and scaffolding techniques. The combination of such highly resolved assembly graphs with long-range scaffolding information promises the complete and automated assembly of complex genomes.},

More recently, the inverse problem — designing an amino acid sequence that will fold into a specified three-dimensional structure — has attracted growing attention as a potential route to the rational engineering of proteins with functions useful in biotechnology and medicine. Methods for the prediction and design of protein structures have advanced dramatically in the past decade. Increases in computing power and the rapid growth in protein sequence and structure databases have fuelled the development of new data-intensive and computationally demanding approaches for structure prediction. New algorithms for designing protein folds and protein–protein interfaces have been used to engineer novel high-order assemblies and to design from scratch fluorescent proteins with novel or enhanced properties, as well as signalling proteins with therapeutic potential. In this Review, we describe current approaches for protein structure prediction and design and highlight a selection of the successful applications they have enabled.},

@article{kuhnertQuantifyingFitnessCost2018,
  abstract     = {Drug resistant HIV is a major threat to the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. Around 10\% of ART-naïve patients in Europe are infected with drug-resistant HIV type 1. Hence it is important to understand the dynamics of transmitted drug resistance evolution. Thanks to routinely performed drug resistance tests, HIV sequence data is increasingly available and can be used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship among viral lineages. In this study we employ a phylodynamic approach to quantify the fitness costs of major resistance mutations in the Swiss HIV cohort. The viral phylogeny reflects the transmission tree, which we model using stochastic birth–death-sampling processes with two types: hosts infected by a sensitive or resistant strain. This allows quantification of fitness cost as the ratio between transmission rates of hosts infected by drug resistant strains and transmission rates of hosts infected by drug sensitive strains. The resistance mutations 41L, 67N, 70R, 184V, 210W, 215D, 215S and 219Q (nRTI-related) and 103N, 108I, 138A, 181C, 190A (NNRTI-related) in the reverse trancriptase and the 90M mutation in the protease gene are included in this study. Among the considered resistance mutations, only the 90M mutation in the protease gene was found to have significantly higher fitness than the drug sensitive strains. The following mutations associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were found to be less fit than the sensitive strains: 67N, 70R, 184V, 219Q. The highest posterior density intervals of the transmission ratios for the remaining resistance mutations included in this study all included 1, suggesting that these mutations do not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility within the Swiss HIV cohort. These patterns are consistent with alternative measures of the fitness cost of resistance mutations. Overall, we have developed and validated a novel phylodynamic approach to estimate the transmission fitness cost of drug resistance mutations.},

@article{kujovichFactorLeidenThrombophilia2011,
  abstract     = {Factor V Leiden is a genetic disorder characterized by a poor anticoagulant response to activated Protein C and an increased risk for venous thromboembolism. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are the most common manifestations, but thrombosis in unusual locations also occurs. The current evidence suggests that the mutation has at most a modest effect on recurrence risk after initial treatment of a first venous thromboembolism. Factor V Leiden is also associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased relative risk for pregnancy loss and possibly other obstetric complications, although the probability of a successful pregnancy outcome is high. The clinical expression of Factor V Leiden is influenced by the number of Factor V Leiden alleles, coexisting genetic and acquired thrombophilic disorders, and circumstantial risk factors. Diagnosis requires the activated Protein C resistance assay (a coagulation screening test) or DNA analysis of the F5 gene, which encodes the Factor V protein. The first acute thrombosis is treated according to standard guidelines. Decisions regarding the optimal duration of anticoagulation are based on an individualized assessment of the risks for venous thromboembolism recurrence and anticoagulant-related bleeding. In the absence of a history of thrombosis, long-term anticoagulation is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic Factor V Leiden heterozygotes, although prophylactic anticoagulation may be considered in high-risk clinical settings. In the absence of evidence that early diagnosis reduces morbidity or mortality, decisions regarding testing at-risk family members should be made on an individual basis.},

@inproceedings{kunanbayevComplexEncoding2021,
  abstract   = {A salient problem in machine learning is transforming categorical variables into efficient numerical features. This focus is warranted due to the ubiquity of categorical data in real-world applications but, on the contrary, the development of many machine learning methods based on the assumption of having numerical variables. Perhaps the most popular existing categorical to numerical conversion techniques include one-hot encoding, thermometer encoding, and ordinal (integer) encoding. One-hot and thermometer encodings become computationally inefficient and may lead to ill-conditioning for high-cardinality categorical variables as they create high-dimensional data matrices. As ordinal encoding does not change data dimensionality, it is significantly more memory-efficient; however, the spurious ordering induced by ordinal encoding among unordered categorical values can hamstring the performance of constructed predictive models. In this paper, we propose a new encoding technique, namely complex encoding, that provides a symmetric representation of categorical values in the complex plane. To show the efficacy of the complex encoding in terms of error rate and memory usage, we conducted a set of numerical experiments using real datasets and the family of linear discriminant functions for complex Gaussian distributions. Empirical results show that not only complex encoding avoids the ill-conditioning problem of one-hot and thermometer encodings, it can generally lead to a comparable or higher classification accuracy with respect to others (when they are applicable) at the expense of only about two-fold increase in memory usage with respect to ordinal encoding.},

Extensive studies on resistance to viral protease inhibitors, particularly those of HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease, revealed a plethora of information on the structural and molecular mechanisms underlying resistance. These insights led to several strategies to improve viral protease inhibitors to counter resistance, such as exploiting the essential biological function and leveraging evolutionary constraints. Incorporation of these strategies into structure-based drug design can minimize vulnerability to resistance, not only for viral proteases but for other quickly evolving drug targets as well, toward designing inhibitors one step ahead of evolution to counter resistance with more intelligent and rational design.},

In the past decade, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has fundamentally changed the genomics landscape by providing tools for the exploration of polyploid genomes. Here, we review the challenges of the assembly of polyploid plant genomes, and also present recent advances in genomic resources and functional tools in molecular genetics and breeding. As genomes of diploid and less heterozygous progenitor species are increasingly available, we discuss the lack of complexity of these currently available reference genomes as they relate to polyploid crops. Finally, we review recent approaches of haplotyping by phasing and the impact of third generation technologies on polyploid plant genome assembly.},

It possesses a ribozyme activity, which can autocatalytically cleave and ligate itself. The ribozyme has a unique structural requirement different from other known ribozymes. HDV RNA undergoes RNA-dependent RNA replication via a double rolling circle mechanism, which is probably mediated by cellular RNA polymerase II, utilizing modified cellular transcription machineries. HDV RNA encodes a single protein, hepatitis delta antigen, which is a nuclear, RNA-binding phosphoprotein and required for viral RNA replication. During replication, HDV RNA undergoes a specific RNA editing event to extend its open reading frame and produce a longer, isoprenylated delta antigen, which suppresses RNA replication and initiates viral particle assembly. Ribozyme, cell-mediated RNA-dependent RNA replication, and RNA editing are some of the unique properties and unresolved issues of the molecular biology of HDV.},

@article{lambVpuVprHuman1997,
  abstract     = {Viral channel-forming proteins comprise a class of viral proteins which, similar to their host companions, are made to alter electrochemical or substrate gradients across lipid membranes. These proteins are active during all stages of the cellular life cycle of viruses. An increasing number of proteins are identified as channel proteins, but the precise role in the viral life cycle is yet unknown for the majority of them. This review presents an overview about these proteins with an emphasis on those with available structural information. A concept is introduced which aligns the transmembrane domains of viral channel proteins with those of host channels and toxins to give insights into the mechanism of function of the viral proteins from potential sequence identities. A summary of to date investigations on drugs targeting these proteins is given and discussed in respect of their mode of action in vivo. The cellular and subcellular membranes encounter an important playground for the activity of membrane proteins encoded by viruses. Viral membrane proteins, similar to their host companions, can be integral or attached to the membrane. They are involved in directing the cellular and viral reproduction, the fusion and budding processes. This review focuses especially on those integral viral membrane proteins which form channels or pores, the classification to be so, modeling by in silico methods and potential drug candidates. The sequence of an isolate of Vpu from HIV-1 is aligned with host ion channels and a toxin. The focus is on the alignment of the transmembrane domains. The results of the alignment are mapped onto the 3D structures of the respective channels and toxin. The results of the mapping support the idea of a ‘channel–pore dualism’ for Vpu. Strictinin, which is a member of the ellagitanin family of hydrolyzable tannins, prevented replication of human, duck and swine influenza A viruses (IAVs) in vitro at non-toxic concentrations. The addition of strictinin at the same time as IAV inoculation to MDCK cells inhibited viral replication in a dose-dependent manner. Strictinin showed 50\% inhibitory concentrations for IAVs from 0.09 ± 0.021 to 0.28 ± 0.037 μM (mean ± S.E.M.) by the focus-forming assay. Treatment of MDCK cells with strictinin before and after viral inoculation resulted in no significant antiviral activity. Further studies showed that strictinin inhibited IAV-induced hemifusion. However, strictinin exhibited no inhibitory effect against receptor binding, sialidase activity. Strictinin also showed an antiviral effect on influenza B virus and human parainfluenza virus type-1 in vitro. The results indicate that strictinin is a useful antiviral agent. Channel-forming proteins are found in a number of viral genomes. In some cases, their role in the viral life cycle is well understood, in some cases it needs still to be elucidated. A common theme is that their mode of action involves a change of electrochemical or proton gradient across the lipid membrane which modulates the viral or cellular activity. Blocking these proteins can be a suitable therapeutic strategy as for some viruses this may be “lethal.” Besides the many biological relevant questions still to be answered, there are also many open questions concerning the biophysical side as well as structural information and the mechanism of function on a molecular level. The immanent biophysical issues are addressed and the work in the field is summarized. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the transmembrane domain (TM) of the Vpu protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) contributes to the pathogenesis of SHIVKU-1bMC33 in macaques and that the TM domain of Vpu could be replaced with the M2 protein viroporin from influenza A virus. Recently, we showed that the replacement of the TM domain of Vpu with that of the M2 protein of influenza A virus resulted in a virus (SHIVM2) that was sensitive to rimantadine [Hout, D.R., Gomez, M.L., Pacyniak, E., Gomez, L.M., Inbody, S.H., Mulcahy, E.R., Culley, N., Pinson, D.M., Powers, M.F., Wong, S.W., Stephens, E.B., 2006. Substitution of the transmembrane domain of Vpu in simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIVKU-1bMC33) with that of M2 of influenza A results in a virus that is sensitive to inhibitors of the M2 ion channel and is pathogenic for pig-tailed macaques. Virology 344, 541–558]. Based on previous studies of the M2 protein which have shown that the His–X–X–X–Trp motif within the M2 is essential to the function of the M2 proton channel, we have constructed a novel SHIV in which the alanine at position 19 of the TM domain was replaced with a histidine residue resulting in the motif His–Ile–Leu–Val–Trp. The SHIVVpuA19H replicated with similar kinetics as the parental SHIVKU-1bMC33 and pulse-chase analysis revealed that the processing of viral proteins was similar to SHIVKU-1bMC33. This SHIVVpuA19H virus was found to be more sensitive to the M2 ion channel blocker rimantadine than SHIVM2. Electron microscopic examination of SHIVVpuA19H-infected cells treated with rimantadine revealed an accumulation of viral particles at the cell surface and within intracellular vesicles, which was similar to that previously observed to SHIVM2-infected cells treated with rimantadine. These data indicate that the Vpu protein of HIV-1 can be converted into a rimantadine-sensitive ion channel with the alteration of one amino acid and provide additional evidence that drugs targeting the Vpu TM/ion channel can be effective anti-HIV-1 drugs. The Vpu protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 has been shown to shunt the CD4 receptor molecule to the proteasome for degradation and to enhance virus release from infected cells. The exact mechanism by which the Vpu protein enhances virus release is currently unknown but some investigators have shown that this function is associated with the transmembrane domain and potential ion channel properties. In this study, we determined if the transmembrane domain of Vpu could be functionally substituted with that of the prototypical viroporin, the M2 protein of influenza A virus. We constructed chimeric vpu gene in which the transmembrane domain of Vpu was replaced with that of the M2 protein of influenza. This chimeric vpu gene was substituted for the vpu gene in the genome of a pathogenic simian human immunodeficiency virus, SHIVKU-1bMC33. The resulting virus, SHIVM2, synthesized a Vpu protein that had a slightly different Mr compared to the parental SHIVKU-1bMC33, reflecting the different sizes of the two Vpu proteins. The SHIVM2 was shown to replicate with slightly reduced kinetics when compared to the parental SHIVKU-1bMC33 but electron microscopy revealed that the site of maturation was similar to the parental virus SHIVKU1bMC33. We show that the replication and spread of SHIVM2 could be blocked with the antiviral drug rimantadine, which is known to target the M2 ion channel. Our results indicate a dose dependent inhibition of SHIVM2 with 100 μM rimantadine resulting in a {$>$}95\% decrease in p27 released into the culture medium. Rimantadine did not affect the replication of the parental SHIVKU-1bMC33. Examination of SHIVM2-infected cells treated with 50 μM rimantadine revealed numerous viral particles associated with the cell plasma membrane and within intracytoplasmic vesicles, which is similar to HIV-1 mutants lacking a functional vpu. To determine if SHIVM2 was as pathogenic as the parental SHIVKU-1bMC33 virus, two pig-tailed macaques were inoculated and followed for up to 8 months. Both pig-tailed macaques developed severe CD4+ T cell loss within 1 month of inoculation, high viral loads, and histological lesions consistent with lymphoid depletion similar to the parental SHIVKU-1bMC33. Taken together, these results indicate for the first time that the TM domain of the Vpu protein can be functionally substituted with the TM of M2 of influenza A virus, and shows that compounds that target the TM domain of Vpu protein of HIV-1 could serve as novel anti-HIV-1 drugs.},

@article{lamCompressedIndexingLocal2008,
  abstract     = {Motivation: Recent experimental studies on compressed indexes (BWT, CSA, FM-index) have confirmed their practicality for indexing very long strings such as the human genome in the main memory. For example, a BWT index for the human genome (with about 3 billion characters) occupies just around 1 G bytes. However, these indexes are designed for exact pattern matching, which is too stringent for biological applications. The demand is often on finding local alignments (pairs of similar substrings with gaps allowed). Without indexing, one can use dynamic programming to find all the local alignments between a text T and a pattern P in O(|T||P|) time, but this would be too slow when the text is of genome scale (e.g. aligning a gene with the human genome would take tens to hundreds of hours). In practice, biologists use heuristic-based software such as BLAST, which is very efficient but does not guarantee to find all local alignments.Results: In this article, we show how to build a software called BWT-SW that exploits a BWT index of a text T to speed up the dynamic programming for finding all local alignments. Experiments reveal that BWT-SW is very efficient (e.g. aligning a pattern of length 3 000 with the human genome takes less than a minute). We have also analyzed BWT-SW mathematically for a simpler similarity model (with gaps disallowed), and we show that the expected running time is O(|T|0.628|P|) for random strings. As far as we know, BWT-SW is the first practical tool that can find all local alignments. Yet BWT-SW is not meant to be a replacement of BLAST, as BLAST is still several times faster than BWT-SW for long patterns and BLAST is indeed accurate enough in most cases (we have used BWT-SW to check against the accuracy of BLAST and found that only rarely BLAST would miss some significant alignments).Availability:www.cs.hku.hk/\\textasciitilde ckwong3/bwtswContact:twlam@cs.hku.hk},

I describe a framework for predicting mapping qualities that works by simulating a set of tandem reads. These are like the input reads in important ways, but the true point of origin is known. I implement this method in an accurate and low-overhead tool called Qtip, which is compatible with popular aligners.},

  abstract     = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates with reduced sensitivity to zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, AZT) from individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex were studied to determine the genetic basis of their resistance. Most were sequential isolates obtained at the initiation of and during therapy. Comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of the reverse transcriptase (RT) coding region from five pairs of sensitive and resistant isolates identified three predicted amino acid substitutions common to all the resistant strains (Asp67----Asn, Lys70----Arg, Thr215----Phe or Tyr) plus a fourth in three isolates (Lys219----Gln). Partially resistant isolates had combinations of these four changes. An infectious molecular clone constructed with these four mutations in RT yielded highly resistant HIV after transfection of T cells. The reproducible nature of these mutations should make it possible to develop rapid assays to predict zidovudine resistance by performing polymerase chain reaction amplification of nucleic acid from peripheral blood lymphocytes, thereby circumventing current lengthy HIV isolation and sensitivity testing.},

@article{lauCurrentTrendsHIV2013,
  abstract     = {One of the major characteristics of HIV-1 is its high genetic variability and extensive heterogeneity. This characteristic is due to its molecular traits, which in turn allows it to vary, recombine, and diversify at a high frequency. As such, it generates complex molecular forms, termed recombinants, which evade the human immune system and so survive. There is no sequence constraint to the recombination pattern as it appears to occur at inter-group (between groups M and O), as well as interand intra-subtype within group M. Rapid emergence and active global transmission of HIV-1 recombinants, known as circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs), requires urgent attention. To date, 55 CRFs have been reported around the world. The first CRF01\_AE originated from Central Africa but spread widely in Asia. The most recent CRF; CRF55\_01B is a recombinant form of CRF01\_AE and subtype B, although its origin is yet to be publicly disclosed. HIV-1 recombination is an ongoing event and plays an indispensable role in HIV epidemics in different regions. Africa, Asia and South America are identified as recombination hot-spots. They are affected by continual emergence and cocirculation of newly emerging CRFs and URFs, which are now responsible for almost 20\% of HIV-1 infections worldwide. Better understanding of recombinants is necessary to determine their biological and molecular attributes.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

  abstract   = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short sequences of ribonucleic acids that control the expression of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by binding them. Robust prediction of miRNA-mRNA pairs is of utmost importance in deciphering gene regulation but has been challenging because of high false positive rates, despite a deluge of computational tools that normally require laborious manual feature extraction. This paper presents an end-to-end machine learning framework for miRNA target prediction. Leveraged by deep recurrent neural networks-based auto-encoding and sequence-sequence interaction learning, our approach not only delivers an unprecedented level of accuracy but also eliminates the need for manual feature extraction. The performance gap between the proposed method and existing alternatives is substantial (over 25\% increase in F-measure), and deepTarget delivers a quantum leap in the longstanding challenge of robust miRNA target prediction.

@article{leeGenomicDarkMatter2012,
  abstract     = {Motivation: Genome resequencing and short read mapping are two of the primary tools of genomics and are used for many important applications. The current state-of-the-art in mapping uses the quality values and mapping quality scores to evaluate the reliability of the mapping. These attributes, however, are assigned to individual reads and do not directly measure the problematic repeats across the genome. Here, we present the Genome Mappability Score (GMS) as a novel measure of the complexity of resequencing a genome. The GMS is a weighted probability that any read could be unambiguously mapped to a given position and thus measures the overall composition of the genome itself.Results: We have developed the Genome Mappability Analyzer to compute the GMS of every position in a genome. It leverages the parallelism of cloud computing to analyze large genomes, and enabled us to identify the 5–14\% of the human, mouse, fly and yeast genomes that are difficult to analyze with short reads. We examined the accuracy of the widely used BWA/SAMtools polymorphism discovery pipeline in the context of the GMS, and found discovery errors are dominated by false negatives, especially in regions with poor GMS. These errors are fundamental to the mapping process and cannot be overcome by increasing coverage. As such, the GMS should be considered in every resequencing project to pinpoint the ‘dark matter’ of the genome, including of known clinically relevant variations in these regions.Availability: The source code and profiles of several model organisms are available at http://gma-bio.sourceforge.netContact:hlee@cshl.eduSupplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of the first non-cellular infectious agent, later determined to be tobacco mosaic virus, paved the way for the field of virology. In the ensuing decades, research focused on discovering and eliminating viral threats to plant and animal health. However, recent conceptual and methodological revolutions have made it clear that viruses are not merely agents of destruction but essential components of global ecosystems. As plants make up over 80\% of the biomass on Earth, plant viruses likely have a larger impact on ecosystem stability and function than viruses of other kingdoms. Besides preventing overgrowth of genetically homogeneous plant populations such as crop plants, some plant viruses might also promote the adaptation of their hosts to changing environments. However, estimates of the extent and frequencies of such mutualistic interactions remain controversial. In this Review, we focus on the origins of plant viruses and the evolution of interactions between these viruses and both their hosts and transmission vectors. We also identify currently unknown aspects of plant virus ecology and evolution that are of practical importance and that should be resolvable in the near future through viral metagenomics.},

@article{leImprovedGeneralAmino2008,
  abstract     = {Amino acid replacement matrices are an essential basis of protein phylogenetics. They are used to compute substitution probabilities along phylogeny branches and thus the likelihood of the data. They are also essential in protein alignment. A number of replacement matrices and methods to estimate these matrices from protein alignments have been proposed since the seminal work of Dayhoff et al. (1972). An important advance was achieved by Whelan and Goldman (2001) and their WAG matrix, thanks to an efficient maximum likelihood estimation approach that accounts for the phylogenies of sequences within each training alignment. We further refine this method by incorporating the variability of evolutionary rates across sites in the matrix estimation and using a much larger and diverse database than BRKALN, which was used to estimate WAG. To estimate our new matrix (called LG after the authors), we use an adaptation of the XRATE software and 3,912 alignments from Pfam, comprising ∼50,000 sequences and ∼6.5 million residues overall. To evaluate the LG performance, we use an independent sample consisting of 59 alignments from TreeBase and randomly divide Pfam alignments into 3,412 training and 500 test alignments. The comparison with WAG and JTT shows a clear likelihood improvement. With TreeBase, we find that 1) the average Akaike information criterion gain per site is 0.25 and 0.42, when compared with WAG and JTT, respectively; 2) LG is significantly better than WAG for 38 alignments (among 59), and significantly worse with 2 alignments only; and 3) tree topologies inferred with LG, WAG, and JTT frequently differ, indicating that using LG impacts not only the likelihood value but also the output tree. Results with the test alignments from Pfam are analogous. LG and a PHYML implementation can be downloaded from http://atgc.lirmm.fr/LG.},

Until the end of February 2020, the number of available genomes was below 1,000, and their multiple alignment was easily achieved using standard approaches. Subsequently, the availability of genomes has grown dramatically. Moreover, some genomes are of low quality with sequencing/assembly errors, making accurate re-alignment of all genomes nearly impossible on a daily basis. A more efficient, yet accurate approach was clearly required to pursue all subsequent bioinformatics analyses of this crucial data.hCoV-19 genomes are highly conserved, with very few indels and no recombination. This makes the profile HMM approach particularly well suited to align new genomes, add them to an existing alignment and filter problematic ones. Using a core of ∼2,500 high quality genomes, we estimated a profile using HMMER, and implemented this profile in COVID-Align, a user-friendly interface to be used online or as standalone via Docker. The alignment of 1,000 genomes requires ∼50mn on our cluster.

  abstract      = {Summary: BWA-MEM is a new alignment algorithm for aligning sequence reads or long query sequences against a large reference genome such as human. It automatically chooses between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance than several state-of-art read aligners to date.

Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads \&gt;200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashing-based software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time.Results: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as SSAHA2, more accurate than BLAT, and is several to tens of times faster than both.Availability:http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.netContact:rd@sanger.ac.uk},

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows–Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10–20× faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format.

However this technology is currently hindered by high error rates in the output data that affect analyses such as the identification of isoforms, exon boundaries, open reading frames and creation of gene catalogues. Due to the novelty of such data, computational methods are still actively being developed and options for the error correction of Nanopore RNA-sequencing long reads remain limited.In this article, we evaluate the extent to which existing long-read DNA error correction methods are capable of correcting cDNA Nanopore reads. We provide an automatic and extensive benchmark tool that not only reports classical error correction metrics but also the effect of correction on gene families, isoform diversity, bias toward the major isoform and splice site detection. We find that long read error correction tools that were originally developed for DNA are also suitable for the correction of Nanopore RNA-sequencing data, especially in terms of increasing base pair accuracy. Yet investigators should be warned that the correction process perturbs gene family sizes and isoform diversity. This work provides guidelines on which (or whether) error correction tools should be used, depending on the application type.https://gitlab.com/leoisl/LR\_EC\_analyser},

  abstract     = {New sequencing technologies promise a new era in the use of DNA sequence. However, some of these technologies produce very short reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence of a diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes full use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and an empirical model for correlated errors at a site. Both read mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on simulated data and real data. MAQ is accurate, efficient, versatile, and user-friendly. It is freely available at http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

Due to the huge amount of data, NGS applications require very fast and accurate alignment algorithms. Most existing algorithms for read mapping basically adopt seed-and-extend strategy, which is sequential in nature and takes much longer time on longer reads. RESULTS: We develop a divide-and-conquer algorithm, called Kart, which can process long reads as fast as short reads by dividing a read into small fragments that can be aligned independently. Our experiment result indicates that the average size of fragments requiring the more time-consuming gapped alignment is around 20\\,bp regardless of the original read length. Furthermore, it can tolerate much higher error rates. The experiments show that Kart spends much less time on longer reads than other aligners and still produce reliable alignments even when the error rate is as high as 15\%.

The algorithm has been implemented in a computer program designed to search protein databases very rapidly.

Secondly, CWT was utilized to extract new feature vector based on wavelet power spectrum (WPS), which contains more abundant information of sequence order in frequency domain and time domain, and PCA was then used to reorganize the feature vector to decrease information redundancy and computational complexity. Finally, a pseudo-amino acid composition feature vector was further formed to represent primary sequence by coupling AAC vector with a set of new feature vector of WPS in an orthogonal space by PCA. As a showcase, the rigorous jackknife cross-validation test was performed on the working datasets. The results indicated that prediction quality has been improved, and the current approach of protein representation may serve as a useful complementary vehicle in classifying other attributes of proteins, such as enzyme family class, subcellular localization, membrane protein types and protein secondary structure, etc.},

Aligning highly divergent sequences remains, however, a difficult task that current algorithms often fail to perform accurately, leaving many proteins or open reading frames poorly annotated. Here, we leverage recent advances in deep learning for language modelling and differentiable programming to propose DEDAL, a flexible model to align protein sequences and detect homologs. DEDAL is a machine learning-based model that learns to align sequences by observing large datasets of raw protein sequences and of correct alignments. Once trained, we show that DEDAL improves by up to two- or three-fold the alignment correctness over existing methods on remote homologs, and better discriminates remote homologs from evolutionarily unrelated sequences, paving the way to improvements on many downstream tasks relying on sequence alignment in structural and functional genomics.},

@article{lloydHighCostFidelity2014,
  abstract     = {The notoriously low fidelity of HIV-1 replication is largely responsible for the virus's rapid mutation rate, facilitating escape from immune or drug control. The error-prone activity of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) is predicted to be the most influential mechanism for generating mutations. The low fidelity of RT has been successfully exploited by nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) that halt viral replication upon incorporation. Consequently, drug-resistant strains have arisen in which the viral RT has an increased fidelity of replication, thus reducing analogue incorporation. Higher fidelity, however, impacts on viral fitness. The appearance of compensatory mutations in combination with higher fidelity NRTI resistance mutations and the subsequent reversion of NRTI-resistant mutations upon cessation of antiretroviral treatment lend support to the notion that higher fidelity exacts a fitness cost. Potential mechanisms for reduced viral fitness are a smaller pool of mutant strains available to respond to immune or drug pressure, slower rates of replication, and a limitation to the dNTP tropism of the virus. Unraveling the relationship between replication fidelity and fitness should lead to a greater understanding of the evolution and control of HIV.},

Here, we introduce a proteome-scale feature discovery approach for IDRs. Our approach, which we call “reverse homology”, exploits the principle that important functional features are conserved over evolution. We use this as a contrastive learning signal for deep learning: given a set of homologous IDRs, the neural network has to correctly choose a held-out homolog from another set of IDRs sampled randomly from the proteome. We pair reverse homology with a simple architecture and standard interpretation techniques, and show that the network learns conserved features of IDRs that can be interpreted as motifs, repeats, or bulk features like charge or amino acid propensities. We also show that our model can be used to produce visualizations of what residues and regions are most important to IDR function, generating hypotheses for uncharacterized IDRs. Our results suggest that feature discovery using unsupervised neural networks is a promising avenue to gain systematic insight into poorly understood protein sequences.},

However, poor bioavailability and unbearable toxicity are their common disadvantages. Thus, the development of safer and potentially promising protease inhibitors is eagerly needed. In this review, we introduced the chemical characteristics and associated side effects of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as the possible off-target mechanisms causing the side effects. From the chemical structures of HIV protease inhibitors and their possible off-target molecules, we could obtain hints for optimizing the molecular selectivity of the inhibitors, to provide help in the design of new compounds with enhanced bioavailability and reduced side effects.},

Integrase is the viral enzyme responsible for the catalytic steps involved in this process, and integrase strand transfer inhibitors are widely used to treat people living with HIV. Over the past decade, a series of X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy studies have revealed the structural basis of retroviral DNA integration. A variable number of integrase molecules congregate on viral DNA ends to assemble a conserved intasome core machine that facilitates integration.

@article{manberSuffixArraysNew1993,
  abstract     = {A new and conceptually simple data structure, called a suffix array, for on-line string searches is introduced in this paper. Constructing and querying suffix arrays is reduced to a sort and search paradigm that employs novel algorithms. The main advantage of suffix arrays over suffix trees is that, in practice, they use three to five times less space. From a complexity standpoint, suffix arrays permit on-line string searches of the type, “Is W a substring of A?” to be answered in time  𝑂(𝑃+log𝑁) O(P+log⁡N) , where P is the length of W and N is the length of A, which is competitive with (and in some cases slightly better than) suffix trees. The only drawback is that in those instances where the underlying alphabet is finite and small, suffix trees can be constructed in  𝑂(𝑁) O(N)  time in the worst case, versus  𝑂(𝑁log𝑁) O(Nlog⁡N)  time for suffix arrays. However, an augmented algorithm is given that, regardless of the alphabet size, constructs suffix arrays in  𝑂(𝑁) O(N) expected time, albeit with lesser space efficiency. It is believed that suffix arrays will prove to be better in practice than suffix trees for many applications.},

@article{mangasarianMultifacetedRoleHIV1997,
  abstract     = {Relatively small genomes and high replication rates allow viruses and bacteria to accumulate mutations. This continuously presents the host immune system with new challenges. On the other side of the trenches, an increasingly well‐adjusted host immune response, shaped by coevolutionary history, makes a pathogen's life a rather complicated endeavor. It is, therefore, no surprise that pathogens either escape detection or modulate the host immune response, often by redirecting normal cellular pathways to their advantage. For the purpose of this chapter, we focus mainly on the manipulation of the class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen presentation pathways and the ubiquitin (Ub)‐proteasome system by both viral and bacterial pathogens. First, we describe the general features of antigen presentation pathways and the Ub‐proteasome system and then address how they are manipulated by pathogens. We discuss the many human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)‐encoded immunomodulatory genes that interfere with antigen presentation (immunoevasins) and focus on the HCMV immunoevasins US2 and US11, which induce the degradation of class I MHC heavy chains by the proteasome by catalyzing their export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)‐membrane into the cytosol, a process termed ER dislocation. US2‐ and US11‐mediated subversion of ER dislocation ensures proteasomal degradation of class I MHC molecules and presumably allows HCMV to avoid recognition by cytotoxic T cells, whilst providing insight into general aspects of ER‐associated degradation (ERAD) which is used by eukaryotic cells to purge their ER of defective proteins. We discuss the similarities and differences between the distinct pathways co‐opted by US2 and US11 for dislocation and degradation of human class I MHC molecules and also a putatively distinct pathway utilized by the murine herpes virus (MHV)‐68 mK3 immunoevasin for ER dislocation of murine class I MHC. We speculate on the implications of the three pathogen‐exploited dislocation pathways to cellular ER quality control. Moreover, we discuss the ubiquitin (Ub)‐proteasome system and its position at the core of antigen presentation as proteolysis and intracellular trafficking rely heavily on Ub‐dependent processes. We add a few examples of manipulation of the Ub‐proteasome system by pathogens in the context of the immune system and such diverse aspects of the host–pathogen relationship as virus budding, bacterial chromosome integration, and programmed cell death, to name a few. Finally, we speculate on newly found pathogen‐encoded deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and their putative roles in modulation of host–pathogen interactions. Background: The HIV Nef protein downregulates CD4 through sequential connection with clathrin-coated pits and the COP1 coatomer, resulting in accelerated endocytosis and lysosomal targeting. Results: Here we report that the small GTPase ARF1 controls the Nef-induced, COP-mediated late-endosomal targeting of CD4. We find that Nef binds ARF1 directly and can recruit the GTPase onto endosomal membranes. Furthermore, a complex comprising Nef, ARF1, and βCOP can be immunoprecipitated from cells expressing the viral protein. Residues in a C-terminal loop of the viral protein facilitate both these interactions and the targeting of Nef and CD4 to acidic late endosomes, whereas other residues primarily involved in mediating CD4 endocytosis are dispensable for this process. Finally, a dominant-negative ARF1 mutant blocks the migration of the Nef-CD4 complex to lysosomes. Conclusions: Our results support a model in which ARF1 is the immediate downstream partner of Nef for CD4 lysosomal targeting. Major histocompatibility complex class II HLA-DR molecules are plasma-membrane integral heterodimers, constitutively expressed in antigen-presenting cells. Their expression is known to be upregulated in peripheral T lymphocytes upon cell activation and to be constitutive in T cell lines. In H78-C10.0, a subclone of the human CD4+ T cell line HUT-78, the transport of MHC class II HLA-DR molecules is blocked, resulting in their localization within internal vesicular compartments rather than at the cell surface. In this article, we show that HIV-1HX10 infection of H78-C10.0 cells induces HLA-DR surface expression. Moreover, the produced infectious viruses harbor the heterodimer molecules in their envelopes. To define which of the viral proteins was involved in this phenomenon, we infected H78-C10.0 cells with recombinant vaccinia vectors containing either the gag-pro coding sequence or the entire env gene. Only gag expression was able to induce HLA-DR cell-surface localization in H78-C10.0 cells. RT-PCR analysis of the infected cells revealed no significant alteration in the amount of HLA-DRα-specific RNA compared to untreated cells. This implies that Gag acts on downstream events. When the env viral gene, coding for the precursor glycoprotein gp160, was expressed in H78-C10.0, the Env protein targeted to the cell surface was poorly processed to its final mature forms gp120 and gp41. However, coexpression of the env and gag genes led to restoration of this phenotype. Although the mechanism is unknown, the data compiled in this study strongly suggest that the viral Gag protein can interact with the cellular trafficking apparatus. Moreover, in a specific cell type as H78-C10.0 this interaction can even reverse intracellular transport defects. Defective deletion mutants can be replicated in superinfected cells by parasitism of the intact virus' replication machinery, and through replication with the host cell. We show by analysis of a mathematical model that dynamic stability of superinfected cell growth is crucial in determining the frequency of deletion mutant infected cells, i.e. there is a critical infectivity threshold ρscbelow which the density of proliferative virus is significantly reduced by the presence of defective deletion mutants. Above ρsc, proliferative virus principally occurs as superinfected cells (wild type with defective deletion mutant). The thresholdρsc , and the interference effects of the deletion mutant, increase with deletion mutant parasitism of the wild-type replication machinery in superinfected cells. The interaction of virally infected cells with host homeostasis determines whether immune escape by deletion mutant infected cells is necessary for the interference window to exist. Only when the deletion mutant has a detrimental effect on infected host cell replication did we observe periodic behaviour. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genome encodes a total of three structural proteins, two envelope proteins, three enzymes, and six accessory proteins. Studies over the past ten years have provided high-resolution three-dimensional structural information for all of the viral enzymes, structural proteins and envelope proteins, as well as for three of the accessory proteins. In some cases it has been possible to solve the structures of the intact, native proteins, but in most cases structural data were obtained for isolated protein domains, peptidic fragments, or mutants. Peptide complexes with two regulatory RNA fragments and a protein complex with an RNA recognition/encapsidation element have also been structurally characterized. This article summarizes the high-resolution structural information that is currently available for HIV proteins and reviews current structure-function and structure-biological relationships. Simian immunodeficiency virus strain PBj14, SIVsmmPBj14, is unique among primate lentiviruses in its ability to trigger the proliferation of resting simian lymphocytes and to cause the rapid death of experimentally inoculated pigtailed macaques. Severe enteropathy, immune activation, and extensive apoptosis, particularly within gut-associated lymphoid tissue, characterize the acute disease syndrome associated with SIVsmmPBj14infection. In the present study, we examined whether the ability of this virus to cause widespread apoptosis might be linked to the up-regulation of Fas ligand (CD95L) expression in virally infected cells.In vitrostudies revealed that expression of the viral Nef protein, in the absence of any other viral gene product, was sufficient to up-regulate the transcriptional activity of the CD95L promoter and to cause cell surface expression of Fas ligand. This up-regulation was NFAT dependent (inhibited by cyclosporin A) and did not occur in cells that expressed a mutated derivative of the viral Nef protein, lacking a previously defined immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. These findings were corroborated by analysis of tissue sections from virally infected macaques. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that Fas ligand expression was efficiently up-regulated in the GALT of animals that had been experimentally infected with wild-type SIVsmmPBj14but not in animals that were infected with a nonacutely pathogenic viral mutant lacking the Nef ITAM. Taken together, these results suggest that the ability of SIVsmmPBj14to cause acutely lethal disease and to up-regulate FasL expression may be linked. Additional studies will be required to determine whether the induction of FasL expression is in itself important for acute disease pathogenesis.},

@article{marcaisImprovingPerformanceMinimizers2017,
  abstract     = {Motivation The minimizers scheme is a method for selecting k-mers from sequences. It is used in many bioinformatics software tools to bin comparable sequences or to sample a sequence in a deterministic fashion at approximately regular intervals, in order to reduce memory consumption and processing time. Although very useful, the minimizers selection procedure has undesirable behaviors (e.g. too many k-mers are selected when processing certain sequences). Some of these problems were already known to the authors of the minimizers technique, and the natural lexicographic ordering of k-mers used by minimizers was recognized as their origin. Many software tools using minimizers employ ad hoc variations of the lexicographic order to alleviate those issues. Results We provide an in-depth analysis of the effect of k-mer ordering on the performance of the minimizers technique. By using small universal hitting sets (a recently defined concept), we show how to significantly improve the performance of minimizers and avoid some of its worse behaviors. Based on these results, we encourage bioinformatics software developers to use an ordering based on a universal hitting set or, if not possible, a randomized ordering, rather than the lexicographic order. This analysis also settles negatively a conjecture (by Schleimer et al.) on the expected density of minimizers in a random sequence.

In this paper we describe MUMmer4, a substantially improved version of MUMmer that addresses genome size constraints by changing the 32-bit suffix tree data structure at the core of MUMmer to a 48-bit suffix array, and that offers improved speed through parallel processing of input query sequences. With a theoretical limit on the input size of 141Tbp, MUMmer4 can now work with input sequences of any biologically realistic length. We show that as a result of these enhancements, the nucmer program in MUMmer4 is easily able to handle alignments of large genomes; we illustrate this with an alignment of the human and chimpanzee genomes, which allows us to compute that the two species are 98\% identical across 96\% of their length. With the enhancements described here, MUMmer4 can also be used to efficiently align reads to reference genomes, although it is less sensitive and accurate than the dedicated read aligners. The nucmer aligner in MUMmer4 can now be called from scripting languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby. These improvements make MUMer4 one the most versatile genome alignment packages available.},

  abstract     = {Pairwise alignment of sequences is a fundamental method in modern molecular biology, implemented within multiple bioinformatics tools and libraries. Current advances in sequencing technologies press for the development of faster pairwise alignment algorithms that can scale with increasing read lengths and production yields.In this article, we present the wavefront alignment algorithm (WFA), an exact gap-affine algorithm that takes advantage of homologous regions between the sequences to accelerate the alignment process. As opposed to traditional dynamic programming algorithms that run in quadratic time, the WFA runs in time O(ns), proportional to the read length n and the alignment score s, using O(s2) memory. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits simple data dependencies that can be easily vectorized, even by the automatic features of modern compilers, for different architectures, without the need to adapt the code. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm, together with other state-of-the-art implementations. As a result, we demonstrate that the WFA runs 20–300× faster than other methods aligning short Illumina-like sequences, and 10–100× faster using long noisy reads like those produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.The WFA algorithm is implemented within the wavefront-aligner library, and it is publicly available at https://github.com/smarco/WFA.},

  abstract     = {The protocols used for library construction, sequencing and data pre-processing can have a great impact on the quality of an assembled transcriptome and the accuracy of gene expression quantification.Before starting an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiment, one should carefully consider using protocols that are strand-specific, that remove ribosomal RNA and that do not require PCR amplification of the template.Strand-specific RNA-seq protocols are important for correctly assembling overlapping transcripts, especially for compact genomes.The reference-based, or ab initio, assembly strategy requires a reference genome and uses much fewer computing resources than the de novo strategy. However, the quality of the genome and the ability of the short-read aligner to align reads across introns will directly influence the accuracy of the assembled transcripts when using the reference-based strategy.The de novo assembly strategy does not use a reference genome but instead uses a De Bruijn graph to represent overlaps between sequences and assemble transcripts. Most de novo approaches require significant computing resources: random access memory (RAM) is the typical limitation. However, de novo assemblers can assemble trans-spliced genes and novel transcripts that are not present in the genome assembly.To take full advantage of the current assembly strategies, a combined assembly approach should be considered that leverages the strengths of reference-based and de novo assembly strategies.Most transcriptome assemblers are still being developed, and the results from these programs should be evaluated using unbiased quantitative metrics.Transcriptome assembly involves an informatics approach to solve an experimental limitation. As sequencing strategies continually improve, it may no longer be necessary in the near future to assemble transcriptomes, as the read length will be longer than any individual transcript.},

  abstract     = {HIV is among the most generically variable of human pathogens. A comprehensive and detailed description of HIV strains in the pandemic is an important foundation for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The current sequence database for HIV includes almost 800 complete genome sequences, documenting HIV-1 groups M, O, and N, and HIV-2. Among HIV-1 group M strains, responsible for the vast majority of HIV infections worldwide, 743 sequences represent 9 genetic subtypes, 16 circulating recombinant forms (CRF) that are spreading in populations, and a variety of unique recombinant forms (URF), identified so far only from a single individual. The global distribution of HIV is complex and dynamic with regional epidemics harboring only a subset of the global diversity. HIV strains differ enormously in terms of global prevalence. Six strains account for the majority of HIV infections: HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D, and two of the CRF, CRF01-AE and CRF02\_AG, respectively. Many of the known subtypes and recombinant forms are currently rare in the epidemic, but could spread more widely if favorable conditions arise. HIV-2 is largely restricted to West Africa at relatively low prevalence there. Groups O and N of HIV-1 are very rare in the pandemic. The goal of universal coverage of HIV-1 strains by diagnostic tests can be met by minimizing false negative test rates for the six globally prevalent HIV-1 group M strains and HIV-2, and by evaluating systematically coverage of rare subtypes and recombinant forms.

  abstract     = {Herpesviruses comprise an abundant, widely distributed group of large DNA viruses of humans and other vertebrates, and overall are among the most extensively studied large DNA viruses. Many herpesvirus genome sequences have been determined, and interpreted in terms of gene contents to give detailed views of both ubiquitous and lineage-specific functions. Availability of gene sequences has also enabled evaluations of evolutionary relationships. For herpesviruses of mammals, a robust phylogenetic tree has been constructed, which shows many features characteristic of synchronous development of virus and host lineages over large evolutionary timespans. It has also emerged that three distinct groupings of herpesviruses exist: the first containing viruses with mammals, birds and reptiles as natural hosts; the second containing viruses of amphibians and fish; and the third consisting of a single invertebrate herpesvirus. Within each of the first two groups, the genomes show clear evidence of descent from a common ancestor, but relationships between the three groups are extremely remote. Detailed analyses of capsid structures provide the best evidence for a common origin of the three groups. At a finer level, the structure of the capsid shell protein further suggests an element of common origin between herpesviruses and tailed DNA bacteriophages.},

@article{menendez-ariasMechanismsResistanceNucleoside2008,
  abstract     = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors can be classified into nucleoside and nonnucleoside RT inhibitors. Nucleoside RT inhibitors are converted to active triphosphate analogues and incorporated into the DNA in RT-catalyzed reactions. They act as chain terminators blocking DNA synthesis, since they lack the 3′-OH group required for the phosphodiester bond formation. Unfortunately, available therapies do not completely suppress viral replication, and the emergence of drug-resistant HIV variants is facilitated by the high adaptation capacity of the virus. Mutations in the RT-coding region selected during treatment with nucleoside analogues confer resistance through different mechanisms: (i) altering discrimination between nucleoside RT inhibitors and natural substrates (dNTPs) (e.g. Q151M, M184V, etc.), or (ii) increasing the RT's phosphorolytic activity (e.g. M41L, T215Y and other thymidine analogue resistance mutations), which in the presence of a pyrophosphate donor (usually ATP) allow the removal of chain-terminating inhibitors from the 3′ end of the primer. Both mechanisms are implicated in multi-drug resistance. The excision reaction can be modulated by mutations conferring resistance to nucleoside or nonnucleoside RT inhibitors, and by amino acid substitutions that interfere with the proper binding of the template-primer, including mutations that affect RNase H activity. New developments in the field should contribute towards improving the efficacy of current therapies.},

Although the first-generation integrase inhibitors are susceptible to the emergence of resistance mutations that impair their efficacy in therapy, such resistance has not been identified to date in drug-naïve patients who have been treated with the second-generation inhibitor dolutegravir. During previous in vitro selection study, we identified a R263K mutation as the most common substitution to arise in the presence of dolutegravir with H51Y arising as a secondary mutation. Additional experiments reported here provide a plausible explanation for the absence of reported dolutegravir resistance among integrase inhibitor-naïve patients to date.},

  abstract     = {The major advance offered by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is the ability to produce, in some cases, in excess of one billion short reads per instrument run, which makes them useful for many biological applications.The variety of NGS features makes it likely that multiple platforms will coexist in the marketplace, with some having clear advantages for particular applications over others.The leading NGS platforms use clonally amplified templates, which are not affected by the arbitrary losses of genomic sequences that are inherent in bacterial cloning methods.An important advantage of single-molecule template platforms is that PCR is not required. PCR can create mutations that masquerade as sequence variants and amplification bias that underrepresents AT-rich and GC-rich regions in target sequences.There are four primary NGS chemistry methods: cyclic reversible termination, sequencing by ligation, pyrosequencing and real-time sequencing, which are described in this Review.To call sequence variants in genomes, NGS reads are aligned to a reference sequence using various bioinformatics mapping tools.Whole-genome sequencing using current NGS platforms is still expensive, but targeting regions of interest may provide an interim solution to analysing hundreds, if not thousands, of samples.To date, the sequences of twelve human genomes have been published using a number of NGS platforms, marking the beginning of personalized genomics.NGS costs will continue to drop in the foreseeable future, although the cost reduction should be weighed against the quality of the produced genome sequence.},

In the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP, mutant RT extended 12\% to 15\% of primers past multiple AZTMP termination sites versus less than 0.5\% for wild type. Although mutant RT also unblocked ddAMP-terminated primers more efficiently than wild-type RT, the removal of ddAMP was effectively inhibited by the next complementary dNTP (IC50 approximately equal to 12 microM). In contrast, the removal of AZTMP was not inhibited by dNTPs except at nonphysiological concentrations (IC50 {$>$} 200 microM).},

While the improved read length can provide useful information for downstream analysis, underlying algorithms are challenged by the high error rate. Error correction methods in which accurate short reads are used to correct noisy long reads appear to be attractive to generate high-quality long reads. Methods that align short reads to long reads do not optimally use the information contained in the second generation data, and suffer from large runtimes. Recently, a new hybrid error correcting method has been proposed, where the second generation data is first assembled into a de Bruijn graph, on which the long reads are then aligned.},

Although emerging long-read technologies have enabled ETR assemblies, the accuracy of such assemblies is difficult to evaluate since there are no tools for their quality assessment. Moreover, since the mapping of error-prone reads to ETRs remains an open problem, it is not clear how to polish draft ETR assemblies.To address these problems, we developed the TandemTools software that includes the TandemMapper tool for mapping reads to ETRs and the TandemQUAST tool for polishing ETR assemblies and their quality assessment. We demonstrate that TandemTools not only reveals errors in ETR assemblies but also improves the recently generated assemblies of human centromeres.https://github.com/ablab/TandemTools.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In this paper we present several improvements that make the Skip-gram model more expressive and enable it to learn higher quality vectors more rapidly.  We show that by subsampling frequent words we obtain significant speedup,  and also learn higher quality representations as measured by our tasks. We also introduce Negative Sampling, a simplified variant of Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) that learns more accurate vectors for frequent words compared to the hierarchical softmax.   An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases.  For example, the meanings of Canada'' and "Air'' cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada''.  Motivated by this example, we present a simple and efficient method for finding phrases, and show that their vector representations can be accurately learned by the Skip-gram model. "},

Both read types can complement one another in a ‘hybrid’ approach to whole-genome shotgun sequencing projects, but assembly software must be modified to accommodate their different characteristics. This is true even of pyrosequencing mated and unmated read combinations. Without special modifications, assemblers tuned for homogeneous sequence data may perform poorly on hybrid data.Results: Celera Assembler was modified for combinations of ABI 3730 and 454 FLX reads. The revised pipeline called CABOG (Celera Assembler with the Best Overlap Graph) is robust to homopolymer run length uncertainty, high read coverage and heterogeneous read lengths. In tests on four genomes, it generated the longest contigs among all assemblers tested. It exploited the mate constraints provided by paired-end reads from either platform to build larger contigs and scaffolds, which were validated by comparison to a finished reference sequence. A low rate of contig mis-assembly was detected in some CABOG assemblies, but this was reduced in the presence of sufficient mate pair data.Availability: The software is freely available as open-source from http://wgs-assembler.sf.net under the GNU Public License.Contact:jmiller@jcvi.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In these trials, there was a high prevalence of HIV-1 resistance mutations, with 94\% of patients having nucleoside-associated mutations and 71\% having thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAMs). Statistically significant HIV-1 RNA reductions associated with tenofovir DF treatment, relative to placebo (P \&lt; .001), were observed for patients without TAMs (n = 97) or for patients with 1–2 (n = 88) or ⩾3 TAMs (n = 147). Response to tenofovir DF was reduced among patients with HIV-1 with ⩾3 TAMs inclusive of either the M41L or L210W mutation (n = 86) or patients who had a preexisting K65R mutation (n = 6). Slightly increased treatment responses were observed when the M184V mutation was present. Phenotypic cutoffs were established at 1.4-fold and 4-fold, respectively, for the beginning of reduced response to tenofovir DF and for a strongly reduced response.

This ORF could encode a protein of approximately 190 amino acid residues with a relative molecular mass of 20 kilodaltons if translation began from the first initiation codon.

  abstract   = {Viruses are microbial parasites that insert information into the cell that they have infected to divert the host synthetic systems to make viral rather than cellular components. The process is absolutely dependent on living cells as viruses have no metabolic machinery themselves. The virus consists of a replicating unit or replicon, and a packaging system to deliver the virus to the cell; if either of these essential but distinct elements is missing the virus cannot multiply. All living things have their own viruses. New methods of virus discovery based on nucleic acid detection rather than infection of cells or disease in organisms are revealing more and more forms, many of which are not yet linked to any disease or disorder. The intimate connection between the cell and the virus makes it possible to study cellular processes in detail but also means that treating virus infections is not straightforward. Key Concepts: Viruses are intracellular parasites that require the machinery of living cells to replicate. They consist of an informational molecule (RNA or DNA) in a delivery package that enables them to move from cell to cell. They have been identified by the diseases they cause, their ability to infect cell cultures and increasingly by purely molecular methods such as deep sequencing. The origin of viruses is not known. Viruses replicate by subverting the cell machinery to the manufacture of virus by subtle means. Some are the causative agents of devastating diseases yet equally some seem to have no ill effects. The intimate relationship between virus and cell means that they can be used to investigate the details of cellular processes but they are difficult to attack.},

@article{minTargetNetFunctionalMicroRNA2022,
  abstract     = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation by binding to target sites of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). While identifying functional targets of miRNAs is of utmost importance, their prediction remains a great challenge. Previous computational algorithms have major limitations. They use conservative candidate target site (CTS) selection criteria mainly focusing on canonical site types, rely on laborious and time-consuming manual feature extraction, and do not fully capitalize on the information underlying miRNA–CTS interactions.In this article, we introduce TargetNet, a novel deep learning-based algorithm for functional miRNA target prediction. To address the limitations of previous approaches, TargetNet has three key components: (i) relaxed CTS selection criteria accommodating irregularities in the seed region, (ii) a novel miRNA–CTS sequence encoding scheme incorporating extended seed region alignments and (iii) a deep residual network-based prediction model. The proposed model was trained with miRNA–CTS pair datasets and evaluated with miRNA–mRNA pair datasets. TargetNet advances the previous state-of-the-art algorithms used in functional miRNA target classification. Furthermore, it demonstrates great potential for distinguishing high-functional miRNA targets. The codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/mswzeus/TargetNet.},

  abstract     = {This mixed-methods study used qualitative interviews to explore discrepancies between self-reported HIV care and treatment-related behaviors and the presence of antiretroviral medications (ARVs) in a population-based survey in South Africa. ARV analytes were identified among 18\% of those reporting HIV-negative status and 18\% of those reporting not being on ART. Among participants reporting diagnosis over a year prior, 19\% reported multiple HIV tests in the past year. Qualitative results indicated that participant misunderstandings about their care and treatment played a substantial role in reporting inaccuracies. Participants conflated the term HIV test with CD4 and viral load testing, and confusion with terminology was compounded by recall difficulties. Data entry errors likely also played a role. Frequent discrepancies between biomarkers and self-reported data were more likely due to poor understanding of care and treatment and biomedical terminology than intentional misreporting. Results indicate a need for improving patient-provider communication, in addition to incorporating objective measures of treatment and care behaviors such as ARV analytes, to reduce inaccuracies.},

We identified ten previously unreported T2D susceptibility loci, including two demonstrating sex-differentiated association. Genome-wide analyses of these data are consistent with a long tail of further common variant loci explaining much of the variation in susceptibility to T2D.

  abstract     = {Cladistic analysis is an approach to phylogeny reconstruction that groups taxa in such a way that those with historically more-recent ancestors form groups nested within groups of taxa with more-distant ancestors. This nested set of taxa can be represented as a branching diagram or tree (a cladogram), which is an hypothesis of the evolutionary history of the taxa. The analysis is performed by searching for nested groups of shared derived character states. These shared derived character states define monophyletic groups of taxa (clades), which include all of the descendants of the most recent common ancestor. If all of the characters for a set of taxa are congruent, then reconstructing the phylogenetic tree is unproblematic. However, most real data sets contain incongruent characters, and consequently a wide range of tree-building methods has been developed. These methods differ in a variety of characteristics, and they may produce topologically distinct trees for a single data set. None of the currently-available methods are simultaneously efficient, powerful, consistent and robust, and thus there is no single ideal method. However, many of them appear to perform well under a wide range of conditions, with the exception of the UPGMA method and the Invariants method.},

Standard approaches are a mainstay of modern molecular biology and rely on variations of edit distance to obtain explicit alignments between pairs of biological sequences. However, sequence alignment algorithms struggle with remote homology tasks and cannot identify similarities between many pairs of proteins with similar structures and likely homology. Recent work suggests that using machine learning language models can improve remote homology detection. To this end, we introduce DeepBLAST, that obtains explicit alignments from residue embeddings learned from a protein language model integrated into an end-to-end differentiable alignment framework. This approach can be accelerated on the GPU architectures and outperforms conventional sequence alignment techniques in terms of both speed and accuracy when identifying structurally similar proteins.},

Score matrices for database search programs or phylogenetic analysis rely on such models of protein evolution. Pioneering work was done by Dayhoff et al. (1978) who formulated a Markov model of evolution and derived the famous PAM score matrices. Her estimation procedure for amino acid exchange frequencies is restricted to pairs of proteins that have a constant and small degree of divergence. Here we present an improved estimator, called the resolvent method, that is not subject to these limitations. This extension of Dayhoff's approach enables us to estimate an amino acid substitution model from alignments of varying degree of divergence. Extensive simulations show the capability of the new estimator to recover accurately the exchange frequencies among amino acids. Based on the SYSTERS database of aligned protein families (Krause and Vingron, 1998) we recompute a series of score matrices.},

Due to the strongly hydrophobic amino acid composition of transmembrane domains, suboptimal results are obtained when general-purpose scoring matrices such as BLOSUM are used. Recently, a transmembrane-specific score matrix called PHAT was shown to perform much better than BLOSUM. In this article, we derive a transmembrane score matrix family, called SLIM, which has several distinguishing features. In contrast to currently used matrices, SLIM is non-symmetric. The asymmetry arises because different background compositions are assumed for the transmembrane query and the unknown database sequences. We describe the mathematical model behind SLIM in detail and show that SLIM outperforms PHAT both on simulated data and in a realistic setting. Since non-symmetric score matrices are a new concept in database search methods, we discuss some important theoretical and practical issues.Contact: muelle\_t@molgen.mpg.de},

Several long-read sequencing technologies are available, and a growing number of algorithms have been developed to assemble the reads generated by those technologies. When starting a new genome project, it is therefore challenging to select the most cost-effective sequencing technology, as well as the most appropriate software for assembly and polishing. It is thus important to benchmark different approaches applied to the same sample.Here, we report a comparison of 3 long-read sequencing technologies applied to the de novo assembly of a plant genome, Macadamia jansenii. We have generated sequencing data using Pacific Biosciences (Sequel I), Oxford Nanopore Technologies (PromethION), and BGI (single-tube Long Fragment Read) technologies for the same sample. Several assemblers were benchmarked in the assembly of Pacific Biosciences and Nanopore reads. Results obtained from combining long-read technologies or short-read and long-read technologies are also presented. The assemblies were compared for contiguity, base accuracy, and completeness, as well as sequencing costs and DNA material requirements.The 3 long-read technologies produced highly contiguous and complete genome assemblies of M. jansenii. At the time of sequencing, the cost associated with each method was significantly different, but continuous improvements in technologies have resulted in greater accuracy, increased throughput, and reduced costs. We propose updating this comparison regularly with reports on significant iterations of the sequencing technologies.},

@article{nanniNewEncodingTechnique2011,
  abstract     = {Research on peptide classification problems has focused mainly on the study of different encodings and the application of several classification algorithms to achieve improved prediction accuracies. The main drawback of the literature is the lack of an extensive comparison among the available encoding methods on a wide range of classification problems. This paper addresses the fundamental issue of which peptide encoding promises the best results for machine learning classifiers. Two novel encoding methods based on physicochemical properties of the amino acids are proposed and an extensive comparison with several standard encoding methods is performed on three different classification problems (HIV-protease, recognition of T-cell epitopes and prediction of peptides that bind human leukocyte antigens). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new encodings and show that the frequently used orthonormal encoding is inferior compared to other methods.},

We review recent data-driven efforts that shed light into the origin and evolution of viruses and explain factors that resist the widespread acceptance of new views and insights. We propose a new definition of viruses that is not restricted to the presence or absence of any genetic or physical feature, detail a scenario for how viruses likely originated from ancient cells, and explain technical and conceptual biases that limit our understanding of virus evolution. We note that the philosophical aspects of virus evolution also impact the way we might prepare for future outbreaks.},

We have introduced two new mechanisms to generate an initial population: the first mechanism is to generate guide trees with randomly selected sequences and the second is shuffling the sequences inside such trees. Two different genetic operators have been implemented with GAPAM. To test the performance of our algorithm, we have compared it with existing well-known methods, such as PRRP, CLUSTALX, DIALIGN, HMMT, SB\_PIMA, ML\_PIMA, MULTALIGN, and PILEUP8, and also other methods, based on genetic algorithms (GA), such as SAGA, MSA-GA, and RBT-GA, by solving a number of benchmark datasets from BAliBase 2.0. To make a fairer comparison with the GA based algorithms such as MSA-GA and RBT-GA, we have performed further experiments covering all the datasets reported by those two algorithms. The experimental results showed that GAPAM achieved better solutions than the others for most of the cases, and also revealed that the overall performance of the proposed method outperformed the other methods mentioned above.},

From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

Unfortunately, the straightforward vector encoding of k-mer as a one-hot vector is vulnerable to the curse of dimensionality. Worse yet, the distance between any pair of one-hot vectors is equidistant. This is particularly problematic when applying the latest machine learning algorithms to solve problems in biological sequence analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel method to train distributed representations of variable-length k-mers. Our method is based on the popular word embedding model word2vec, which is trained on a shallow two-layer neural network. Our experiments provide evidence that the summing of dna2vec vectors is akin to nucleotides concatenation. We also demonstrate that there is correlation between Needleman-Wunsch similarity score and cosine similarity of dna2vec vectors.},

However, since transmembrane regions of a protein are in a distinctly different environment than globular proteins, one would expect generalized substitution matrices to be inappropriate for transmembrane regions. RESULTS: We present the PHAT (predicted hydrophobic and transmembrane) matrix, which significantly outperforms generalized matrices and a previously published transmembrane matrix in searches with transmembrane queries. We conclude that a better matrix can be constructed by using background frequencies characteristic of the twilight zone, where low-scoring true positives have scores indistinguishable from high-scoring false positives, rather than the amino acid frequencies of the database. The PHAT matrix may help improve the accuracy of sequence alignments and evolutionary trees of membrane proteins.},

Converting genome sequence to graph by using frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) is an excellent gene sequence mapping technology, which can store rich genetic information into FCGR graphics. To each FCGR image, we construct its perceptual image hashing (PIH) matrix using the bicubic interpolation zooming. The difference of the perceptual hash matrix of each two images is calculated, and the clustering distance of the corresponding two gene sequences is represented by the differentials of the perceptual hash matrix. In this paper, we aligned and analyzed several typical genome sequence datasets including mammalian mitochondrial genes, human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) to build their evolutionary trees. Experimental results showed that our PIH combining FCGR method (FCGR-PIH) has similar classification accuracy to the classical Clustal W sequence alignment method. Furthermore, 25 complete mitochondrial DNA sequences of cichlid fishes and 27 Escherichia coli/Shigella full genome sequences were selected from the AFproject test platform for tests. The performance benchmark rankings demonstrate the effectiveness of the FCGR-PIH algorithm and its potential for large-scale genome sequence analysis.},

@article{nickleHIVSpecificProbabilisticModels2007,
  abstract     = {Comparative sequence analyses, including such fundamental bioinformatics techniques as similarity searching, sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference, have become a mainstay for researchers studying type 1 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) genome structure and evolution. Implicit in comparative analyses is an underlying model of evolution, and the chosen model can significantly affect the results. In general, evolutionary models describe the probabilities of replacing one amino acid character with another over a period of time. Most widely used evolutionary models for protein sequences have been derived from curated alignments of hundreds of proteins, usually based on mammalian genomes. It is unclear to what extent these empirical models are generalizable to a very different organism, such as HIV-1–the most extensively sequenced organism in existence. We developed a maximum likelihood model fitting procedure to a collection of HIV-1 alignments sampled from different viral genes, and inferred two empirical substitution models, suitable for describing between-and within-host evolution. Our procedure pools the information from multiple sequence alignments, and provided software implementation can be run efficiently in parallel on a computer cluster. We describe how the inferred substitution models can be used to generate scoring matrices suitable for alignment and similarity searches. Our models had a consistently superior fit relative to the best existing models and to parameter-rich data-driven models when benchmarked on independent HIV-1 alignments, demonstrating evolutionary biases in amino-acid substitution that are unique to HIV, and that are not captured by the existing models. The scoring matrices derived from the models showed a marked difference from common amino-acid scoring matrices. The use of an appropriate evolutionary model recovered a known viral transmission history, whereas a poorly chosen model introduced phylogenetic error. We argue that our model derivation procedure is immediately applicable to other organisms with extensive sequence data available, such as Hepatitis C and Influenza A viruses.},

We named it COFFEE (Consistency based Objective Function For alignmEnt Evaluation). The COFFEE score reflects the level of consistency between a multiple sequence alignment and a library containing pairwise alignments of the same sequences. RESULTS: We show that multiple sequence alignments can be optimized for their COFFEE score with the genetic algorithm package SAGA. The COFFEE function is tested on 11 test cases made of structural alignments extracted from 3D\_ali. These alignments are compared to those produced using five alternative methods. Results indicate that COFFEE outperforms the other methods when the level of identity between the sequences is low. Accuracy is evaluated by comparison with the structural alignments used as references. We also show that the COFFEE score can be used as a reliability index on multiple sequence alignments. Finally, we show that given a library of structure-based pairwise sequence alignments extracted from FSSP, SAGA can produce high-quality multiple sequence alignments. The main advantage of COFFEE is its flexibility. With COFFEE, any method suitable for making pairwise alignments can be extended to making multiple alignments.

SAGA uses an automatic scheduling scheme to control the usage of 22 different operators for combining alignments or mutating them between generations. When used to optimise the well known sums of pairs objective function, SAGA performs better than some of the widely used alternative packages. This is seen with respect to the ability to achieve an optimal solution and with regard to the accuracy of alignment by comparison with reference alignments based on sequences of known tertiary structure.

With T-Coffee we pre-process a data set of all pair-wise alignments between the sequences. This provides us with a library of alignment information that can be used to guide the progressive alignment. Intermediate alignments are then based not only on the sequences to be aligned next but also on how all of the sequences align with each other. This alignment information can be derived from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment programs and/or structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the power of the approach by using a combination of local and global pair-wise alignments to generate the library. The resulting alignments are significantly more reliable, as determined by comparison with a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives that we tried. The improvement, especially clear with the more difficult test cases, is always visible, regardless of the phylogenetic spread of the sequences in the tests.},

@article{nurkHiCanuAccurateAssembly2020,
  abstract     = {Complete and accurate genome assemblies form the basis of most downstream genomic analyses and are of critical importance. Recent genome assembly projects have relied on a combination of noisy long-read sequencing and accurate short-read sequencing, with the former offering greater assembly continuity and the latter providing higher consensus accuracy. The recently introduced Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi sequencing technology bridges this divide by delivering long reads ({$>$}10 kbp) with high per-base accuracy ({$>$}99.9\%). Here we present HiCanu, a modification of the Canu assembler designed to leverage the full potential of HiFi reads via homopolymer compression, overlap-based error correction, and aggressive false overlap filtering. We benchmark HiCanu with a focus on the recovery of haplotype diversity, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) variants, satellite DNAs, and segmental duplications. For diploid human genomes sequenced to 30× HiFi coverage, HiCanu achieved superior accuracy and allele recovery compared to the current state of the art. On the effectively haploid CHM13 human cell line, HiCanu achieved an NG50 contig size of 77 Mbp with a per-base consensus accuracy of 99.999\% (QV50), surpassing recent assemblies of high-coverage, ultralong Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) reads in terms of both accuracy and continuity. This HiCanu assembly correctly resolves 337 out of 341 validation BACs sampled from known segmental duplications and provides the first preliminary assemblies of nine complete human centromeric regions. Although gaps and errors still remain within the most challenging regions of the genome, these results represent a significant advance toward the complete assembly of human genomes.},

Immobilized DNA fragments amplified with the polymerase chain reaction are used as template. A detection primer is annealed in front of the mutation and four aliquots of this mixture are incubated with DNA polymerase and one of the four different dideoxynucleotides. The presence or absence of an incorporated dideoxynucleotide is thereafter monitored by the release of inorganic pyrophosphate during the following primer extension step. We show that the concept can be used for sequencing of single bases as well as step-wise analysis of several subsequent bases.},

The problem arises in the design of compact hash functions and other data structures for efficient handling of large sequencing datasets. We prove that the problem of hitting a given set of L-long sequences is NP-hard and give a heuristic solution that finds a compact universal k-mer set that hits any set of L-long sequences. The algorithm, called DOCKS (design of compact k-mer sets), works in two phases: (i)\~finding a minimum-size k-mer set that hits every infinite sequence; (ii)\~greedily adding k-mers such that together they hit all remaining L-long sequences. We show that DOCKS works well in practice and produces a set of k-mers that is much smaller than a random choice of k-mers. We present results for various values of k and sequence lengths L and by applying them to two bacterial genomes show that universal hitting k-mers improve on minimizers.

Consequently, it is not trivial to know the quality of MSAs when reference alignments are not provided. Recent scores tend to use more complex evaluations adding supplementary biological features. In this work, a set of novel regression approaches are proposed for the MSA evaluation, comparing several supervised learning and mathematical methodologies. Therefore, the following models specifically designed for regression are applied: regression trees, a bootstrap aggregation of regression trees (bagging trees), least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) and Gaussian processes. These algorithms consider a heterogeneous set of biological features together with other standard MSA scores in order to predict the quality of alignments. The most relevant features are then applied to build novel score schemes for the evaluation of alignments. The proposed algorithms are validated by using the BAliBASE benchmark. Additionally, an statistical ANOVA test is performed to study the relevance of these scores considering three alignment factors. According to the obtained results, the four regression models provide accurate evaluations, even outperforming other standard scores such as BLOSUM, PAM or STRIKE.},

  abstract     = {The genomic era has seen a remarkable increase in the number of genomes being sequenced and annotated. Nonetheless, annotation remains a serious challenge for compositionally biased genomes. For the preliminary annotation, popular nucleotide and protein comparison methods such as BLAST are widely employed. These methods make use of matrices to score alignments such as the amino acid substitution matrices. Since a nucleotide bias leads to an overall bias in the amino acid composition of proteins, it is possible that a genome with nucleotide bias may have introduced atypical amino acid substitutions in its proteome. Consequently, standard matrices fail to perform well in sequence analysis of these genomes. To address this issue, we examined the amino acid substitution in the AT-rich genome of Plasmodium falciparum, chosen as a reference and reconstituted a substitution matrix in the genome's context. The matrix was used to generate protein sequence alignments for the parasite proteins that improved across the functional regions. We attribute this to the consistency that may have been achieved amid the target and background frequencies calculated exclusively in our study. This study has important implications on annotation of proteins that are of experimental interest but give poor sequence alignments with standard conventional matrices.},

Although previous studies have compared the alignment accuracy of different MSA programs, their computational time and memory usage have not been systematically evaluated. Given the unprecedented amount of data produced by next generation deep sequencing platforms, and increasing demand for large-scale data analysis, it is imperative to optimize the application of software. Therefore, a balance between alignment accuracy and computational cost has become a critical indicator of the most suitable MSA program. We compared both accuracy and cost of nine popular MSA programs, namely CLUSTALW, CLUSTAL OMEGA, DIALIGN-TX, MAFFT, MUSCLE, POA, Probalign, Probcons and T-Coffee, against the benchmark alignment dataset BAliBASE and discuss the relevance of some implementations embedded in each program’s algorithm. Accuracy of alignment was calculated with the two standard scoring functions provided by BAliBASE, the sum-of-pairs and total-column scores, and computational costs were determined by collecting peak memory usage and time of execution.},

However, since currently used treatments are unable to eradicate HIV from infected individuals, therapy must be lifelong, with the potential for short- and long-term, known and unknown, side effects, and high costs for health care systems. In addition, different patterns of unexpected systemic complications involving heart, bone, kidney and other organs are emerging. Although their pathogenesis is still under debate, they are likely to originate from chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction associated to HIV infection. A final consideration regards the dishomogenous pattern of HIV disease worldwide. In fact, access to HIV diagnosis, treatment and care are seriously limited in the geographical areas that are most affected, like Africa, which sustains 70\% of the global burden of the infection. This is one of the greatest challenges that international institutions are asked to face today.},

However, a perceived limitation of these ultra-high-throughput technologies is their short read-lengths. De novo assembly of sequence reads generated by classical Sanger capillary sequencing is a mature field of research. Unfortunately, the existing sequence assembly programs were not effective for short sequence reads generated by Illumina and SOLiD platforms. Early studies suggested that, in principle, sequence reads as short as 20–30 nucleotides could be used to generate useful assemblies of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome sequences, albeit containing many gaps. The early feasibility studies and proofs of principle inspired several bioinformatics research groups to implement new algorithms as freely available software tools specifically aimed at assembling reads of 30–50 nucleotides in length. This has led to the generation of several draft genome sequences based exclusively on short sequence Illumina sequence reads, recently culminating in the assembly of the 2.25-Gb genome of the giant panda from Illumina sequence reads with an average length of just 52 nucleotides. As well as reviewing recent developments in the field, we discuss some practical aspects such as data filtering and submission of assembly data to public repositories.},

@article{pearceSolutionProteinStructure2021,
  abstract     = {{$<$}p{$>$}Since Anfinsen demonstrated that the information encoded in a protein's amino acid sequence determines its structure in 1973, solving the protein structure prediction problem has been the Holy Grail of structural biology. The goal of protein structure prediction approaches is to utilize computational modeling to determine the spatial location of every atom in a protein molecule starting from only its amino acid sequence. Depending on whether homologous structures can be found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), structure prediction methods have been historically categorized as template-based modeling (TBM) or template-free modeling (FM) approaches. Until recently, TBM has been the most reliable approach to predicting protein structures, and in the absence of reliable templates, the modeling accuracy sharply declines. Nevertheless, the results of the most recent community-wide assessment of protein structure prediction experiment (CASP14) have demonstrated that the protein structure prediction problem can be largely solved through the use of end-to-end deep machine learning techniques, where correct folds could be built for nearly all single-domain proteins without using the PDB templates. Critically, the model quality exhibited little correlation with the quality of available template structures, as well as the number of sequence homologs detected for a given target protein. Thus, the implementation of deep-learning techniques has essentially broken through the 50-year-old modeling border between TBM and FM approaches and has made the success of high-resolution structure prediction significantly less dependent on template availability in the PDB library.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A sequence, Asp-Thr-Gly, which is conserved in retroviral proteases is also conserved in the active sites of aspartic proteases, an observation which has led to the suggestion that the retroviral proteases could belong to this family5,6. We have examined the sequences of the aspartic and retroviral protease families, using pattern-recognition, structure prediction and molecular modelling techniques, and conclude that the viral protease sequences probably correspond to a single domain of an aspartic protease and may function in a dimeric form.

  abstract  = {Efficient dynamic programming algorithms are available for a broad class of protein and DNA sequence comparison problems. These algorithms require computer time proportional to the product of the lengths of the two sequences being compared [O(N2)] but require memory space proportional only to the sum of these lengths [O(N)]. Although the requirement for O(N2) time limits use of the algorithms to the largest computers when searching protein and DNA sequence databases, many other applications of these algorithms, such as calculation of distances for evolutionary trees and comparison of a new sequence to a library of sequence profiles, are well within the capabilities of desktop computers. In particular, the results of library searches with rapid searching programs, such as FASTA2,48 or BLAST49, should be confirmed by performing a rigorous optimal alignment. Whereas rapid methods do not overlook significant sequence similarities,64 FASTA limits the number of gaps that can be inserted into an alignment, so that a rigorous alignment may extend the alignment substantially in some cases. BLAST does not allow gaps in the local regions that it reports; a calculation that allows gaps is very likely to extend the alignment substantially. Although a Monte Carlo evaluation of the statistical significance of a similarity score with a rigorous algorithm is much slower than the heuristic approach used by the RDF2 program,2 the dynamic programming approach should take less than 1 hr on a 386-based PC or desktop Unix workstation. For descriptive purposes, we have limited our discussion to methods for calculating similarity scores and distances that use gap penalties of the form g = rk. Nevertheless, programs for the more general case (g = q + rk) are readily available.9,23 Versions of these programs that run either on Unix workstations, IBM-PC class computers, or the Macintosh can be obtained from either of the authors.},

FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments.

In the last decades, HIV treatments have become better and better at slowing down the evolution of drug resistance, so that some patients are treated for many years without having any resistance problems. However, for some patients, especially in low-income countries, drug resistance is still a serious threat to their health. This essay will review what is known about transmitted and acquired drug resistance, multi-class drug resistance, resistance to newer drugs, resistance due to treatment for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, the role of minority variants (low-frequency drug-resistance mutations), and resistance due to pre-exposure prophylaxis.},

  abstract     = {MinION is a portable nanopore sequencing device that can be easily operated in the field with features including monitoring of run progress and selective sequencing. To fully exploit these features, real-time base calling is required. Up to date, this has only been achieved at the cost of high computing requirements that pose limitations in terms of hardware availability in common laptops and energy consumption.We developed a new base caller DeepNano-coral for nanopore sequencing, which is optimized to run on the Coral Edge Tensor Processing Unit, a small USB-attached hardware accelerator. To achieve this goal, we have designed new versions of two key components used in convolutional neural networks for speech recognition and base calling. In our components, we propose a new way of factorization of a full convolution into smaller operations, which decreases memory access operations, memory access being a bottleneck on this device. DeepNano-coral achieves real-time base calling during sequencing with the accuracy slightly better than the fast mode of the Guppy base caller and is extremely energy efficient, using only 10\\,W of power.https://github.com/fmfi-compbio/coral-basecallerSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

These include molecular biology, virology and evolutionary biology. It also impacts the daily practice of clinicians and public health officials.                                         •               Here we review three important aspects of viral recombination: (i) molecular mechanisms of model DNA- and RNA-viruses, (ii) methods for detection, characterization and quantification in viral populations, (iii) its impact on the evolutionary analysis of viral populations.                                 , Recombination is a pervasive process generating diversity in most viruses. It joins variants that arise independently within the same molecule, creating new opportunities for viruses to overcome selective pressures and to adapt to new environments and hosts. Consequently, the analysis of viral recombination attracts the interest of clinicians, epidemiologists, molecular biologists and evolutionary biologists. In this review we present an overview of three major areas related to viral recombination: (i) the molecular mechanisms that underlie recombination in model viruses, including DNA-viruses (Herpesvirus) and RNA-viruses (Human Influenza Virus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus), (ii) the analytical procedures to detect recombination in viral sequences and to determine the recombination breakpoints, along with the conceptual and methodological tools currently used and a brief overview of the impact of new sequencing technologies on the detection of recombination, and (iii) the major areas in the evolutionary analysis of viral populations on which recombination has an impact. These include the evaluation of selective pressures acting on viral populations, the application of evolutionary reconstructions in the characterization of centralized genes for vaccine design, and the evaluation of linkage disequilibrium and population structure.},

  abstract  = {Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) of homologous sequences contain information on structural and functional constraints and their evolutionary histories. Despite their importance for many downstream tasks, such as structure prediction, MSA generation is often treated as a separate pre-processing step, without any guidance from the application it will be used for. Here, we implement a smooth and differentiable version of the Smith-Waterman pairwise alignment algorithm that enables jointly learning an MSA and a downstream machine learning system in an end-to-end fashion. To demonstrate its utility, we introduce SMURF (Smooth Markov Unaligned Random Field), a new method that jointly learns an alignment and the parameters of a Markov Random Field for unsupervised contact prediction. We find that SMURF learns MSAs that mildly improve contact prediction on a diverse set of protein and RNA families. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that by connecting our differentiable alignment module to AlphaFold and maximizing predicted confidence, we can learn MSAs that improve structure predictions over the initial MSAs. Interestingly, the alignments that improve AlphaFold predictions are self-inconsistent and can be viewed as adversarial. This work highlights the potential of differentiable dynamic programming to improve neural network pipelines that rely on an alignment and the potential dangers of relying on black-box methods for optimizing predictions of protein sequences.},

@article{pommierIntegraseInhibitorsTreat2005,
  abstract     = {HIV-1 integrase is a rational target for anti-HIV therapy, and the feasibility and efficacy of integrase inhibitors in animal models has been recently demonstrated.Integrase catalyses the insertion of the viral cDNA ends generated by reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome into host chromosomes. The integration reaction consists of two consecutive steps: 3′-processing and strand transfer.Several structures of retroviral integrases have been solved. Integrase is structurally similar to other DNA-processing polynucleotide transferases, including the Tn5 and mu transposases, RuvC recombinase, RnaseH and the RNase component Argonaute. All of these contain a conserved DDE motif required for enzymatic activity. Divalent metals (almost certainly at least one, and probably two, Mg2+ or Mn2+ atoms) coordinate the integrase DDE motif, the viral cDNA and chromosomal DNA for the integration reactions.Integrase can be used for high-throughput screening and a variety of inhibitors from diverse chemical classes have been identified. Criteria required to demonstrate targeting of cellular integrase are reviewed.Diketo acids and diketo-like acids are the most promising integrase inhibitors. They are referred to as strand-transfer inhibitors because they uncouple the two integrase reactions. They can block strand transfer without affecting 3′-processing by chelating divalent cofactors in the integrase active site and by interfering with host (acceptor) DNA binding.Strand-transfer inhibitors probably bind at the interface of the integrase–metal cofactor–viral DNA ternary complex by chelating the divalent metal, and thereby interfering with the binding of the chromosomal target DNA. Strand-transfer inhibitors are candidate interfacial inhibitors, and represent a new mechanism of action in drug discovery.},

  abstract   = {Viruses infecting members of Archaea, the third domain of life, constitute an integral, yet unique part of the virosphere. Many of these viruses, specifically the species that infect hyperthermophilic hosts, display morphotypes – for example, bottle shaped, spindle shaped, droplet shaped, coil shaped, bacilliform – not known to be associated with the other two cellular domains, Bacteria and Eukarya. The distinctiveness of the hyperthermophilic archaeal viruses extends to their genome sequences: a large majority of the predicted genes yield no sequence matches in public databases and encode proteins with exceptional structures and unknown functions. Moreover, the ways in which these viruses interact with their hosts are also unique, as indicated by a unique virion egress mechanism, which involves formation of pyramidal portals on the cell surface. Some viruses that infect extremely halophilic Archaea are morphologically highly similar to head-tail bacterial viruses of the order Caudovirales and apparently share an ancestry with them. Identified archaeal viruses almost exclusively carry double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) genomes and only a few species have single-stranded DNA genomes. Key Concepts Archaea, the third domain of life, same as the two other domains, Bacteria and Eukarya, is parasitised by viruses. Known species of archaeal viruses have been isolated from environments with extreme conditions – extremely high temperatures, exceeding 80 °C, or extremely high salinity. Known archaeal viruses have DNA genomes, most of which are double stranded. Morphological diversity of archaeal viruses exceeds that of bacterial viruses (bacteriophages). Archaeal viruses from extreme thermal environments are enveloped and have diverse unusual morphologies, indicative of multiple independent origins. Most known viruses from highly saline waters resemble bacteriophages and share an ancestry with them. Most of the genes of hyperthermophilic archaeal viruses have no homologues in other known viruses. The knowledge on viruses of Archaea contributes to the understanding of the origin and evolution of viruses and virus–host interactions.},

  abstract     = {So far, all characterized archaeal viruses carry dsDNA genomes and exhibit a wide range of virion morphotypes, strongly surpassing the dsDNA viruses of the Bacteria in their diversity.In addition to head-tail viruses, which are common in the Bacteria, the Archaea replicate many viruses with morphologies which have not been observed before for any dsDNA virus. These include fusiforms, droplet and bottle shapes, and linear and spherical virions, with more complex virions combining features of the different forms.Genome sequence analyses demonstrate that most of the archaeal viruses are unrelated to other known viruses and indicate that they might have different, and possibly multiple, evolutionary origins.Assuming that archaeal head-tail viruses originate from the domain Bacteria (there are many arguments for this suggestion), we are faced with the prospect that each of the three domains of life, the Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya, was originally characterized by a unique set of associated dsDNA viruses.One possible explanation for the existence of three different 'virospheres', each associated with a specific domain, is that these virospheres were selected when the domains first arose. Therefore, the first evolving organisms of each separate domain could have already been infected by different subsets of viruses from the ancestral virosphere, which predated the last universal common ancestor.},

  abstract     = {Background We recently described FastTree, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to FastTree that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability. Methodology/Principal Findings Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the “CAT” approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100–1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory. Conclusions/Significance FastTree 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. FastTree 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

  abstract     = {The ability to characterize repetitive regions of the human genome is limited by the read lengths of short-read sequencing technologies. Although long-read sequencing technologies such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio)\~and Oxford Nanopore Technologies can potentially overcome this limitation, long segmental duplications with high sequence identity pose challenges for long-read mapping. We describe a probabilistic method, DuploMap, designed to improve the accuracy of long-read mapping in segmental duplications. It analyzes reads mapped to segmental duplications using existing long-read aligners and leverages paralogous sequence variants (PSVs)—sequence differences between paralogous sequences—to distinguish between multiple alignment locations. On simulated datasets, DuploMap increased the percentage of correctly mapped reads with high confidence for multiple long-read aligners including Minimap2 (74.3–90.6\%) and BLASR (82.9–90.7\%) while maintaining high precision. Across multiple whole-genome long-read datasets, DuploMap aligned an additional 8–21\% of the reads in segmental duplications with high confidence relative to Minimap2. Using DuploMap-aligned PacBio circular consensus sequencing reads, an additional 8.9 Mb of DNA sequence was mappable, variant calling achieved a higher F1\~score and 14\~713 additional variants supported by linked-read data were identified. Finally, we demonstrate that a significant fraction of PSVs in segmental duplications overlaps with variants and adversely impacts short-read variant calling.},

These SVs have positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes of 800–1400nt that are encapsidated within \\textasciitilde 17-nmT=1 icosahedral virions. SVs, in contrast to satellite-RNA or -DNA, encode a capsid protein for independent genome packaging of the cognate SV RNA.

  abstract     = {We present a new method for predicting the secondary structure of globular proteins based on non-linear neural network models. Network models learn from existing protein structures how to predict the secondary structure of local sequences of amino acids. The average success rate of our method on a testing set of proteins non-homologous with the corresponding training set was 64.3\% on three types of secondary structure (α-helix, β-sheet, and coil), with correlation coefficients of Cα = 0.41, Cβ = 0.31 and Ccoll = 0.41. These quality indices are all higher than those of previous methods. The prediction accuracy for the first 25 residues of the N-terminal sequence was significantly better. We conclude from computational experiments on real and artificial structures that no method based solely on local information in the protein sequence is likely to produce significantly better results for non-homologous proteins. The performance of our method of homologous proteins is much better than for non-homologous proteins, but is not as good as simply assuming that homologous sequences have identical structures.},

This discovery stimulated investigation of the pathogenesis of poliomyelitis in many laboratories. Nearly 50 years later, when two effective poliovirus vaccines were developed, the impetus to study poliovirus pathogenesis waned. The identification of the cell receptor for poliovirus, CD155, and its use in the development of transgenic mice susceptible to poliovirus revived interest in understanding how the virus causes disease. Experiments in CD155 transgenic mice have provided new information on the initial sites of virus replication in the host, how the virus spreads to the central nervous system through the blood and by axonal transport, the determinants of viral tropism, and the basis for the attenuation phenotype of the Sabin vaccine strains. Despite these advances, our understanding of poliovirus pathogenesis is still incomplete. The dilemma is not how to answer the remaining questions, but whether there will be sufficient time to do so before global eradication of poliomyelitis leads to cessation of research on the disease.},

There is little evidence that fitness differences among strains determine their population structure and distribution.Genetic recombination is a fundamental mechanism for the evolution of HIV.The development of drug treatments has greatly extended life expectancy and quality of life for those who are HIV positive but the development of drug resistance has been a major setback.Recombination can rapidly bring together resistance mutations for multiple drugs during combination therapy.The development of a vaccine for HIV has been a frustratingly slow process with the few candidate vaccines that have made it to phase III trials demonstrating no efficacy.The high rate of evolution means that the pattern of diversity of HIV is changing at an alarming rate.Vaccines are therefore aiming at a constantly moving target.},

Protein language models studied to date have been trained to perform inference from individual sequences. The longstanding approach in computational biology has been to make inferences from a family of evolutionarily related sequences by fitting a model to each family independently. In this work we combine the two paradigms. We introduce a protein language model which takes as input a set of sequences in the form of a multiple sequence alignment. The model interleaves row and column attention across the input sequences and is trained with a variant of the masked language modeling objective across many protein families. The performance of the model surpasses current state-of-the-art unsupervised structure learning methods by a wide margin, with far greater parameter efficiency than prior state-of-the-art protein language models.},

We now present its 1,181,404-base pair genome sequence, consisting of 1262 putative open reading frames, 10\% of which exhibit a similarity to proteins of known functions. In addition to exceptional genome size, Mimivirus exhibits many features that distinguish it from other nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses. The most unexpected is the presence of numerous genes encoding central protein-translation components, including four amino-acyl transfer RNA synthetases, peptide release factor 1, translation elongation factor EF-TU, and translation initiation factor 1. The genome also exhibits six tRNAs. Other notable features include the presence of both type I and type II topoisomerases, components of all DNA repair pathways, many polysaccharide synthesis enzymes, and one intein-containing gene. The size and complexity of the Mimivirus genome challenge the established frontier between viruses and parasitic cellular organisms. This new sequence data might help shed a new light on the origin of DNA viruses and their role in the early evolution of eukaryotes.},

However, traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is time-consuming, low throughput and viable only for cultivable bacteria. Machine learning methods may pave the way for automated AMR prediction based on genomic data of the bacteria. However, comparing different machine learning methods for the prediction of AMR based on different encodings and whole-genome sequencing data without previously known knowledge remains to be done.In this study, we evaluated logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for the prediction of AMR for the antibiotics ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and gentamicin. We could demonstrate that these models can effectively predict AMR with label encoding, one-hot encoding and frequency matrix chaos game representation (FCGR encoding) on whole-genome sequencing data. We trained these models on a large AMR dataset and evaluated them on an independent public dataset. Generally, RFs and CNNs perform better than LR and SVM with AUCs up to 0.96. Furthermore, we were able to identify mutations that are associated with AMR for each antibiotic.Source code in data preparation and model training are provided at GitHub website (https://github.com/YunxiaoRen/ML-iAMR).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract     = {The selection of drug resistant virus is a significant obstacle to the continued successful treatment of HIV infection. Reverse transcriptase is the target for numerous approved anti-HIV drugs including both nucleoside inhibitor (NRTI) and non-nucleosides (NNRTI). The many available crystal structures of RT reveal that, generally, in relation to their binding sites NRTI resistance mutations are generally more distally positioned, whilst for NNRTIs mutations are clustered. Such clustering implies a direct stereochemical basis for NNRTI resistance mechanisms, which is indeed observed in many cases such as the loss of key ring stacking interactions with inhibitors via mutations at Tyr181 and Tyr188. However, there are also indirect resistance mechanisms observed, e.g. V108I (via perturbation of Tyr188 and Tyr181) and K103N (apo-enzyme stabilisation). The resistance mechanism can be NNRTI-dependent as is the case for K101E where either indirect (nevirapine) or direct effects (efavirenz) apply. Structural studies have contributed to the design of newer generation NNRTIs and identified a number of features which may contribute to their much improved resistance profiles. Such factors include reduced interactions with Tyr181, the presence of inhibitor/main-chain H-bonds and ability to undergo conformational flexing and rearrangement within the mutated drug site.},

Despite the importance of protein analysis, only a handful of techniques are available to determine protein sequences, and these methods face limitations, for example, requiring a sizable amount of sample. Single-molecule techniques would revolutionize proteomics research, providing ultimate sensitivity for the detection of low-abundance proteins and the realization of single-cell proteomics. In recent years, novel single-molecule protein sequencing schemes that use fluorescence, tunnelling currents and nanopores have been proposed. Here, we present a review of these approaches, together with the first experimental efforts towards their realization. We discuss their advantages and drawbacks, and present our perspective on the development of single-molecule protein sequencing techniques.},

@article{rheeHIV1SubtypeProtease2007,
  abstract     = {Despite the high degree of HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) mutation in the setting of antiretroviral therapy, the spectrum of possible virus variants appears to be limited by patterns of amino acid covariation. We analyzed patterns of amino acid covariation in protease and RT sequences from more than 7,000 persons infected with HIV-1 subtype B viruses obtained from the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu). In addition, we examined the relationship between conditional probabilities associated with a pair of mutations and the order in which those mutations developed in viruses for which longitudinal sequence data were available. Patterns of RT covariation were dominated by the distinct clustering of Type I and Type II thymidine analog mutations and the Q151M-associated mutations. Patterns of protease covariation were dominated by the clustering of nelfinavir-associated mutations (D30N and N88D), two main groups of protease inhibitor (PI)–resistance mutations associated either with V82A or L90M, and a tight cluster of mutations associated with decreased susceptibility to amprenavir and the most recently approved PI darunavir. Different patterns of covariation were frequently observed for different mutations at the same position including the RT mutations T69D versus T69N, L74V versus L74I, V75I versus V75M, T215F versus T215Y, and K219Q/E versus K219N/R, and the protease mutations M46I versus M46L, I54V versus I54M/L, and N88D versus N88S. Sequence data from persons with correlated mutations in whom earlier sequences were available confirmed that the conditional probabilities associated with correlated mutation pairs could be used to predict the order in which the mutations were likely to have developed. Whereas accessory nucleoside RT inhibitor–resistance mutations nearly always follow primary nucleoside RT inhibitor–resistance mutations, accessory PI-resistance mutations often preceded primary PI-resistance mutations.},

For trios, Merqury can also evaluate haplotype-specific accuracy, completeness, phase block continuity, and switch errors. Multiple visualizations, such as k-mer spectrum plots, can be generated for evaluation.

  abstract     = {Single-molecule, real-time sequencing developed by Pacific BioSciences offers longer read lengths than the second-generation sequencing (SGS) technologies, making it well-suited for unsolved problems in genome, transcriptome, and epigenetics research. The highly-contiguous de novo assemblies using PacBio sequencing can close gaps in current reference assemblies and characterize structural variation (SV) in personal genomes. With longer reads, we can sequence through extended repetitive regions and detect mutations, many of which are associated with diseases. Moreover, PacBio transcriptome sequencing is advantageous for the identification of gene isoforms and facilitates reliable discoveries of novel genes and novel isoforms of annotated genes, due to its ability to sequence full-length transcripts or fragments with significant lengths. Additionally, PacBio’s sequencing technique provides information that is useful for the direct detection of base modifications, such as methylation. In addition to using PacBio sequencing alone, many hybrid sequencing strategies have been developed to make use of more accurate short reads in conjunction with PacBio long reads. In general, hybrid sequencing strategies are more affordable and scalable especially for small-size laboratories than using PacBio Sequencing alone. The advent of PacBio sequencing has made available much information that could not be obtained via SGS alone.},

@article{richmanSusceptibilityNucleosideAnalogues1990,
  abstract     = {The emergence of human immunodeficiency virus resistant to 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT) in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex has been documented. Isolates from non-AZT-treated persons or those who had received AZT for less than six months showed a narrow range of susceptibility to the drug; on the other hand, isolates from those who had received AZT for six months or more consistently showed reduced susceptibility. Five highly AZT-resistant isolates were also insensitive to other compounds containing a 3′-azido group. No cross-resistance was found to other nucleoside analogues, including 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine and 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine. That cross-resistance occurred only in compounds containing a 3′-azido group suggests that mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene prohibit the enzyme from using nucleoside triphosphate containing a 3′-azido group. Progressive, stepwise increases in resistance have been associated with the sequential accumulation of specific amino acid changes in the reverse transcriptase gene. It is not yet known whether the resistant phenotype as determined in vitro results in clinical resistance to AZT. The gradual appearance of resistant isolates, the variable course of human immunodeficiency virus infections, and the absence of a consistent pattern of resurgent p24 antigen will make the emergence of AZT resistance difficult to correlate with clinical status or other markers. The combination of AZT with other drugs that do not share cross-resistance is a promising area for investigation to identify regimens that are more active and less likely to induce resistance.},

The combination antiretroviral regimen, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine, taken as a single pill once daily, has been shown to prevent HIV transmission but is used by fewer than 20\% of people who could benefit in the United States.PubMed was searched on February 15, 2018, using the search terms pre-exposure, prophylaxis, HIV, and PrEP to identify English-language articles published between 2010 and 2018. Four placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with daily dosing of TDF/emtricitabine significantly reduces HIV acquisition in men who have sex with men, high-risk heterosexuals, and injection drug users who share injection equipment. The efficacy of daily TDF/emtricitabine exceeds 90\% but is highly correlated with degree of adherence. TDF/emtricitabine is safe and well-tolerated. Only 2\% of people discontinue PrEP because of adverse effects. Sexually transmitted infections are common among those using PrEP. Resistance to TDF/emtricitabine when used for PrEP is rare (\&lt;0.1\%) and usually occurs when PrEP is inadvertently prescribed to individuals with undiagnosed acute HIV infection who have false-negative findings on HIV antibody/antigen testing due to HIV infection acquired within 7 to 10 days of testing. Effective methods are needed to identify individuals at high risk for acquiring HIV, ensure their access to PrEP, and maximize medication adherence.TDF/emtricitabine is an effective and safe therapy for preventing HIV transmission. Increasing prescription of TDF/emtricitabine for patients at risk of acquiring HIV has the potential to reduce new HIV infections.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy is essential for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients to inhibit viral replication and therewith to slow progression of disease and prolong a patient's life. However, the high mutation rate of HIV can lead to a fast adaptation of the virus under drug pressure and thereby to the evolution of resistant variants. In turn, these variants will lead to the failure of antiretroviral treatment. Moreover, these mutations cannot only lead to resistance against single drugs, but also to cross-resistance, i.e., resistance against drugs that have not yet been applied. METHODS: 662 protease sequences and 715 reverse transcriptase sequences with complete resistance profiles were analyzed using machine learning techniques, namely binary relevance classifiers, classifier chains, and ensembles of classifier chains. RESULTS: In our study, we applied multi-label classification models incorporating cross-resistance information to predict drug resistance for two of the major drug classes used in antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1, namely protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). By means of multi-label learning, namely classifier chains (CCs) and ensembles of classifier chains (ECCs), we were able to improve overall prediction accuracy for all drugs compared to hitherto applied binary classification models. CONCLUSIONS: The development of fast and precise models to predict drug resistance in HIV-1 is highly important to enable a highly effective personalized therapy. Cross-resistance information can be exploited to improve prediction accuracy of computational drug resistance models.},

In biology, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Learning the natural distribution of evolutionary protein sequence variation is a logical step toward predictive and generative modeling for biology. To this end we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model maps raw sequences to representations of biological properties without labels or prior domain knowledge. The learned representation space organizes sequences at multiple levels of biological granularity from the biochemical to proteomic levels. Learning recovers information about protein structure: secondary structure and residue-residue contacts can be extracted by linear projections from learned representations. With small amounts of labeled data, the ability to identify tertiary contacts is further improved. Learning on full sequence diversity rather than individual protein families increases recoverable information about secondary structure. We show the networks generalize by adapting them to variant activity prediction from sequences only, with results that are comparable to a state-of-the-art variant predictor that uses evolutionary and structurally derived features.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract     = {Recombination contributes to the generation of genetic diversity in human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) but can only occur between viruses replicating within the same cell. Since individuals have not been found to be simultaneously coinfected with multiple divergent strains of HIV-1 or HIV-2, recombination events have been thought to be restricted to the rather closely related members of the quasispecies that evolves during the course of HIV infection. Here we describe examples of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 genomes that appear to be hybrids of genetically quite divergent viruses. Phylogenetic analyses were used to examine the evolutionary relationships among multiple HIV strains. Evolutionary trees derived from different genomic regions were consistent with respect to most of the viruses investigated. However, some strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2 exhibited significantly discordant branching orders indicative of genetic exchanges during their evolutionary histories. The crossover points of these putative recombination events were mapped by examining the distribution of phylogenetically informative sites supporting alternative tree topologies. A similar example of a recombinant simian immunodeficiency virus identified in West African green monkeys has also been described recently. These results indicate that coinfection with highly divergent viral strains can occur in HIV-infected humans and SIV-infected primates and could lead to the generation of hybrid genomes with significantly altered biological properties. Thus, future characterization of primate lentiviruses should include careful phylogenetic investigation of possible genomic mosaicism.},

@article{robertsReducingStorageRequirements2004,
  abstract     = {Motivation: Comparison of nucleic acid and protein sequences is a fundamental tool of modern bioinformatics. A dominant method of such string matching is the ‘seed-and-extend’ approach, in which occurrences of short subsequences called ‘seeds’ are used to search for potentially longer matches in a large database of sequences. Each such potential match is then checked to see if it extends beyond the seed. To be effective, the seed-and-extend approach needs to catalogue seeds from virtually every substring in the database of search strings. Projects such as mammalian genome assemblies and large-scale protein matching, however, have such large sequence databases that the resulting list of seeds cannot be stored in RAM on a single computer. This significantly slows the matching process.Results: We present a simple and elegant method in which only a small fraction of seeds, called ‘minimizers’, needs to be stored. Using minimizers can speed up string-matching computations by a large factor while missing only a small fraction of the matches found using all seeds.},

@article{ruffaloAccurateEstimationShort2012,
  abstract     = {Motivation: Several software tools specialize in the alignment of short next-generation sequencing reads to a reference sequence. Some of these tools report a mapping quality score for each alignment—in principle, this quality score tells researchers the likelihood that the alignment is correct. However, the reported mapping quality often correlates weakly with actual accuracy and the qualities of many mappings are underestimated, encouraging the researchers to discard correct mappings. Further, these low-quality mappings tend to correlate with variations in the genome (both single nucleotide and structural), and such mappings are important in accurately identifying genomic variants.Approach: We develop a machine learning tool, LoQuM (LOgistic regression tool for calibrating the Quality of short read mappings, to assign reliable mapping quality scores to mappings of Illumina reads returned by any alignment tool. LoQuM uses statistics on the read (base quality scores reported by the sequencer) and the alignment (number of matches, mismatches and deletions, mapping quality score returned by the alignment tool, if available, and number of mappings) as features for classification and uses simulated reads to learn a logistic regression model that relates these features to actual mapping quality.Results: We test the predictions of LoQuM on an independent dataset generated by the ART short read simulation software and observe that LoQuM can ‘resurrect’ many mappings that are assigned zero quality scores by the alignment tools and are therefore likely to be discarded by researchers. We also observe that the recalibration of mapping quality scores greatly enhances the precision of called single nucleotide polymorphisms.Availability: LoQuM is available as open source at http://compbio.case.edu/loqum/.Contact:matthew.ruffalo@case.edu.},

@article{ruffaloComparativeAnalysisAlgorithms2011,
  abstract     = {MOTIVATION: The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques presents many novel opportunities for many applications in life sciences. The vast number of short reads produced by these techniques, however, pose significant computational challenges. The first step in many types of genomic analysis is the mapping of short reads to a reference genome, and several groups have developed dedicated algorithms and software packages to perform this function. As the developers of these packages optimize their algorithms with respect to various considerations, the relative merits of different software packages remain unclear. However, for scientists who generate and use NGS data for their specific research projects, an important consideration is choosing the software that is most suitable for their application. RESULTS: With a view to comparing existing short read alignment software, we develop a simulation and evaluation suite, Seal, which simulates NGS runs for different configurations of various factors, including sequencing error, indels and coverage. We also develop criteria to compare the performances of software with disparate output structure (e.g. some packages return a single alignment while some return multiple possible alignments). Using these criteria, we comprehensively evaluate the performances of Bowtie, BWA, mr- and mrsFAST, Novoalign, SHRiMP and SOAPv2, with regard to accuracy and runtime. CONCLUSION: We expect that the results presented here will be useful to investigators in choosing the alignment software that is most suitable for their specific research aims. Our results also provide insights into the factors that should be considered to use alignment results effectively. Seal can also be used to evaluate the performance of algorithms that use deep sequencing data for various purposes (e.g. identification of genomic variants).

@article{sahlinEffectiveSequenceSimilarity2021,
  abstract     = {k-mer-based methods are widely used in bioinformatics for various types of sequence comparisons. However, a single mutation will mutate k consecutive k-mers and make most k-mer-based applications for sequence comparison sensitive to variable mutation rates. Many techniques have been studied to overcome this sensitivity, for example, spaced k-mers and k-mer permutation techniques, but these techniques do not handle indels well. For indels, pairs or groups of small k-mers are commonly used, but these methods first produce k-mer matches, and only in a second step, a pairing or grouping of k-mers is performed. Such techniques produce many redundant k-mer matches owing to the size of k. Here, we propose strobemers as an alternative to k-mers for sequence comparison. Intuitively, strobemers consist of two or more linked shorter k-mers, where the combination of linked k-mers is decided by a hash function. We use simulated data to show that strobemers provide more evenly distributed sequence matches and are less sensitive to different mutation rates than k-mers and spaced k-mers. Strobemers also produce higher match coverage across sequences. We further implement a proof-of-concept sequence-matching tool StrobeMap and use synthetic and biological Oxford Nanopore sequencing data to show the utility of using strobemers for sequence comparison in different contexts such as sequence clustering and alignment scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Oxford Nanopore (ONT) is a leading long-read technology which has been revolutionizing transcriptome analysis through its capacity to sequence the majority of transcripts from end-to-end. This has greatly increased our ability to study the diversity of transcription mechanisms such as transcription initiation, termination, and alternative splicing. However, ONT still suffers from high error rates which have thus far limited its scope to reference-based analyses. When a reference is not available or is not a viable option due to reference-bias, error correction is a crucial step towards the reconstruction of the sequenced transcripts and downstream sequence analysis of transcripts. In this paper, we present a novel computational method to error correct ONT cDNA sequencing data, called isONcorrect. IsONcorrect is able to jointly use all isoforms from a gene during error correction, thereby allowing it to correct reads at low sequencing depths. We are able to obtain a median accuracy of 98.9–99.6\%, demonstrating the feasibility of applying cost-effective cDNA full transcript length sequencing for reference-free transcriptome analysis.},

Therefore, it is desirable to perform the alignment step as fast as possible without compromising accuracy. Most alignment algorithms consider a seed-and-extend approach, where the time-consuming seeding step identifies and decides on candidate mapping locations. Recently, several advances have been made on seeding methods for fast sequence comparison. We combine two such methods, syncmers and strobemers, in a novel seeding approach for constructing dynamic-sized fuzzy seeds and implement the method in a short-read aligner, strobealign. Firstly, we show that our seeding is fast to construct and effectively reduces repetitiveness in the seeding step using a novel metric E-hits. Secondly, we benchmark strobealign to traditional and recently proposed aligners on simulated and biological data and show that strobealign is several times faster than traditional aligners such as BWA and Bowtie2 at similar and sometimes higher accuracy while being both faster and more accurate than more recently proposed aligners. Our aligner can free up substantial time and computing resources needed for read alignment in many pipelines. Availability https://github.com/ksahlin/strobealign.},

A common bottleneck is the dearth of scalable and accurate algorithms for clustering long reads according to their gene family of origin. To address this challenge, we develop isONclust, a clustering algorithm that is greedy (to scale) and makes use of quality values (to handle variable error rates). We test isONclust on three simulated and five biological data sets, across a breadth of organisms, technologies, and read depths. Our results demonstrate that isONclust is a substantial improvement over previous approaches, both in terms of overall accuracy and/or scalability to large data sets.},

However, they are not modern phenomena; deadly pandemics have happened throughout recorded history. Pandemics such as the plague, Spanish Flu, HIV, and Ebola caused deaths, destruction of political regimes, as well as financial and psychosocial burdens. However, they sometimes resulted in scientific discoveries. Understanding the mechanism of the emergence of these pandemics is crucial to control any spreading pandemic and prevent the emergence of a potential new one. Public health agencies need to work on improving the countries’ pandemic preparedness to prevent any future pandemics. The review article aims to shed light on some of the deadliest pandemics throughout history, information of critical importance for clinicians and researchers.},

  abstract  = {2. Abstract Complete, accurate, cost-effective, and high-throughput reconstruction of bacterial genomes for large-scale genomic epidemiological studies is currently only possible with hybrid assembly, combining long- (typically using nanopore sequencing) and short-read (Illumina) datasets. Being able to utilise nanopore-only data would be a significant advance. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have recently released a new flowcell (R10.4) and chemistry (Kit12), which reportedly generate per-read accuracies rivalling those of Illumina data. To evaluate this, we sequenced DNA extracts from four commonly studied bacterial pathogens, namely Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, using Illumina and ONT’s R9.4.1/Kit10, R10.3/Kit12, R10.4/Kit12 flowcells/chemistries. We compared raw read accuracy and assembly accuracy for each modality, considering the impact of different nanopore basecalling models, commonly used assemblers, sequencing depth, and the use of duplex versus simplex reads. “Super accuracy” (sup) basecalled R10.4 reads - in particular duplex reads - have high per-read accuracies and could be used to robustly reconstruct bacterial genomes without the use of Illumina data. However, the per-run yield of duplex reads generated in our hands with standard sequencing protocols was low (typically {$<$}10\%), with substantial implications for cost and throughput if relying on nanopore data only to enable bacterial genome reconstruction. In addition, recovery of small plasmids with the best-performing long-read assembler (Flye) was inconsistent. R10.4/Kit12 combined with sup basecalling holds promise as a singular sequencing technology in the reconstruction of commonly studied bacterial genomes, but hybrid assembly (Illumina+R9.4.1 hac) currently remains the highest throughput, most robust, and cost-effective approach to fully reconstruct these bacterial genomes. Impact statement Our understanding of microbes has been greatly enhanced by the capacity to evaluate their genetic make-up using a technology known as whole genome sequencing. Sequencers represent microbial genomes as stretches of shorter sequence known as ‘reads’, which are then assembled using computational algorithms. Different types of sequencing approach have advantages and disadvantages with respect to the accuracy and length of the reads they generate; this in turn affects how reliably genomes can be assembled.Currently, to completely reconstruct bacterial genomes in a high-throughput and cost-effective manner, researchers tend to use two different types of sequencing data, namely Illumina (short-read) and nanopore (long-read) data. Illumina data are highly accurate; nanopore data are much longer, and this combination facilitates accurate and complete bacterial genomes in a so-called “hybrid assembly”. However, new developments in nanopore sequencing have reportedly greatly improved the accuracy of nanopore data, hinting at the possibility of requiring only a single sequencing approach for bacterial genomics.Here we evaluate these improvements in nanopore sequencing in the reconstruction of four bacterial reference strains, where the true sequence is already known. We show that although these improvements are extremely promising, for high-throughput, low-cost complete reconstruction of bacterial genomes hybrid assembly currently remains the optimal approach.

  abstract     = {An extended spectrum of HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase (RT) mutations in HAART-treated patients has been recently described. To verify the possible association of previously unreported RT mutations with a decrease of phenotypic susceptibility to nucleoside (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside (NNRTIs) RT inhibitors, the RT sequence of 328 HIV-1-positive patients (102 naïve and 226 treated with HAART participating in either the PhenGen or Genpherex study) was analyzed. All treated patients were tested at the time of therapeutic failure with both phenotypic (Antivirogram\\textregistered , Virco) and genotypic analyses (VircoGen\\texttrademark ); the frequency of RT substitutions (positions 1–240) with respect to consensus B was compared to that of naïve patients using a Chi-square test. Amino acid changes at 13 positions not included in the IAS list of resistance-associated mutations were detected more frequently in treated than in naïve subjects. The mutations involving 10 of these positions were associated with a reduced susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs; K20R, T39A, K43EQN, E203KD, H208Y, and D218E were correlated with NRTI resistance while mutations K101EQP, H221Y, K223EQ, L228HR were associated to NNRTI resistance. A correlation was found between K20R and lamivudine resistance (P = 0.006) while T39A (P = 0.005), K43EQN ({$<$}0.001), E203KD (P = 0.010), and H208Y (P = {$<$} 0.001) seemed to be associated with a previous use of zidovudine and stavudine and with the development of thymidine analog resistance. For H208Y, an association with use/resistance to abacavir (P = 0.004) was also noted. D218E showed a weak association to didanosine resistance (P = 0.013). The data confirm that previously unreported mutations are associated with antiretroviral drug experience and, more importantly, with a reduced susceptibility to NRTIs and NNRTIs. J. Med.

@article{sarafianosLamivudine3TCResistance1999,
  abstract     = {An important component of triple-drug anti-AIDS therapy is 2', 3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC, lamivudine). Single mutations at residue 184 of the reverse transcriptase (RT) in HIV cause high-level resistance to 3TC and contribute to the failure of anti-AIDS combination therapy. We have determined crystal structures of the 3TC-resistant mutant HIV-1 RT (M184I) in both the presence and absence of a DNA/DNA template-primer. In the absence of a DNA substrate, the wild-type and mutant structures are very similar. However, comparison of crystal structures of M184I mutant and wild-type HIV-1 RT with and without DNA reveals repositioning of the template-primer in the M184I/DNA binary complex and other smaller changes in residues in the dNTP-binding site. On the basis of these structural results, we developed a model that explains the ability of the 3TC-resistant mutant M184I to incorporate dNTPs but not the nucleotide analog 3TCTP. In this model, steric hindrance is expected for NRTIs with beta- or L- ring configurations, as with the enantiomer of 3TC that is used in therapy. Steric conflict between the oxathiolane ring of 3TCTP and the side chain of beta-branched amino acids (Val, Ile, Thr) at position 184 perturbs inhibitor binding, leading to a reduction in incorporation of the analog. The model can also explain the 3TC resistance of analogous hepatitis B polymerase mutants. Repositioning of the template-primer as observed in the binary complex (M184I/DNA) may also occur in the catalytic ternary complex (M184I/DNA/3TCTP) and contribute to 3TC resistance by interfering with the formation of a catalytically competent closed complex.},

  abstract     = {The rapid replication of HIV-1 and the errors made during viral replication, cause the virus to evolve rapidly in patients, making the problems of vaccine development and drug therapy particularly challenging. In the absence of an effective vaccine, drugs are the only useful treatment. Anti-HIV drugs work; so far drug therapy has saved more than three million years of life. Unfortunately, HIV-1 develops resistance to all of the available drugs. Although a number of useful anti-HIV drugs have been approved for use in patients, the problems associated with drug toxicity and the development of resistance means that the search for new drugs is an ongoing process. The three viral enzymes, reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN), and protease (PR) are all good drug targets. Two distinct types of RT inhibitors, both of which block the polymerase activity of RT, have been approved to treat HIV-1 infections, nucleoside analogs (NRTIs) and nonnucleosides (NNRTIs), and there are promising leads for compounds that either block the RNase H activity or block the polymerase in other ways. A better understanding of the structure and function(s) of RT and of the mechanism(s) of inhibition can be used to generate better drugs; in particular drugs that are effective against the current drug-resistant strains of HIV-1.},

@article{sardiuScoreStatisticsGlobal2005,
  abstract     = {Sequence alignment is one of the most important bioinformatics tools for modern molecular biology. The statistical characterization of gapped alignment scores has been a long-standing problem in sequence alignment research. Using a variant of the directed path in random media model, we investigate the score statistics of global sequence alignment taking into account, in particular, the compositional bias of the sequences compared. Such statistics are used to distinguish accidental similarity due to compositional similarity from biologically significant similarity. To accommodate the compositional bias, we introduce an extra parameter p indicating the probability for positive matching scores to occur. When p is small, a high scoring alignment obviously cannot come from compositional similarity. When p is large, the highest scoring point within a global alignment tends to be close to the end of both sequences, in which case we say the system percolates. By applying finite-size scaling theory on percolating probability functions of various sizes (sequence lengths), the critical p at infinite size is obtained. For alignment of length t, the fact that the score fluctuation grows as chi(t)1/3 is confirmed upon investigating the scaling form of the alignment score. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics test, we show that the random variable , if properly scaled, follows the Tracy-Widom distributions: Gaussian orthogonal ensemble for p slightly larger than pc and Gaussian unitary ensemble for larger p. Although these results deepen our understanding of the distribution of alignment scores, the use of these results in practical applications remains somewhat heuristic and needs to be further developed. Nevertheless, the possibility of characterizing score statistics for modest system size (sequence lengths), via proper reparametrization of alignment scores, is illustrated.},

  abstract     = {The existence of an antisense Open Reading Frame (ORF) that encodes a putative AntiSense Protein (ASP) on the proviral genome of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) was a source of debate for 30 years. During the last years, some progresses have been made to characterize the cellular immune response against ASP in HIV-1 seropositive patients. However, no tools were available for the detection of antibodies to ASP in the plasma of HIV-1-infected patients during the natural course of the infection. The aim of our study was to develop a Luciferase Immuno-Precipitation System (LIPS) to monitor the quantitative detection of ASP-specific antibodies in the plasma of HIV-1-infected patients [antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive-patients, patients under ART and HIV-1 controllers], patients who discontinued antiretroviral drugs (ARV). We further used this approach to delineate the epitopes of ASP targeted by antibodies. Antibodies directed against ASP were detected in 3 out of 19 patients who discontinued ARV (15\%) and in 1 out of 10 ART-naive patients (10\%), but were neither detected in HIV-1 infected patients under ART nor in HIV-1 controllers. Individual variations in levels of ASP-specific antibodies were detected overtime. Both the conserved prolin-rich motif and the core 60–189 region of ASP were found to be essential for antibody recognition in the four patients tested positive for anti-ASP antibodies, who were all untreated at the time of sampling. Moreover, for two of these patients, increased levels of ASP-specific antibodies were observed concomitantly to viremia declines. Overall, our method may represent a useful tool to detect a humoral response to ASP in HIV-1-infected patients, which allowed us to confirm the expression of ASP during the course of HIV-1 infection. Further studies will be needed to fully characterize the humoral response to ASP in HIV-1-infected patients.},

@article{scarsiHIV1IntegraseInhibitors2020,
  abstract     = {The newest class of antiretrovirals for all persons living with HIV are the integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Since 2007, five INSTIs have been introduced: raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir, bictegravir, and cabotegravir. The INSTIs have favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, which contribute to both their effectiveness and ease of use. With the exception of cabotegravir, each INSTI is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for treatment-naïve individuals initiating antiretroviral therapy. All of the INSTIs, except raltegravir, are approved for antiretroviral treatment simplification for virologically suppressed patients without INSTI resistance. Data also support the use of dolutegravir and raltegravir in individuals with antiretroviral resistance as part of an optimized antiretroviral regimen. INSTIs are generally well tolerated by people living with HIV compared with older classes of antiretrovirals, but emerging data suggest that some INSTIs contribute to weight gain. Due to their efficacy, safety, and ease of use, HIV treatment guidelines recommend oral INSTIs as preferred components of antiretroviral therapy for individuals initiating therapy. The newest INSTI, cabotegravir, represents an alternative to oral administration of life-long antiretroviral therapy with the availability of a long acting injectable formulation. This review summarizes the current use of INSTIs in adults living with HIV, highlighting the similarities and differences within the class related to pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety, dosing and administration that contribute to their role in modern antiretroviral therapy.},

  abstract     = {Mapping short reads against a reference genome is classically the first step of many next-generation sequencing data analyses, and it should be as accurate as possible. Because of the large number of reads to handle, numerous sophisticated algorithms have been developped in the last 3 years to tackle this problem. In this article, we first review the underlying algorithms used in most of the existing mapping tools, and then we compare the performance of nine of these tools on a well controled benchmark built for this purpose. We built a set of reads that exist in single or multiple copies in a reference genome and for which there is no mismatch, and a set of reads with three mismatches. We considered as reference genome both the human genome and a concatenation of all complete bacterial genomes. On each dataset, we quantified the capacity of the different tools to retrieve all the occurrences of the reads in the reference genome. Special attention was paid to reads uniquely reported and to reads with multiple hits.},

@article{schneiderEmpiricalCodonSubstitution2005,
  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Codon substitution probabilities are used in many types of molecular evolution studies such as determining Ka/Ks ratios, creating ancestral DNA sequences or aligning coding DNA. Until the recent dramatic increase in genomic data enabled construction of empirical matrices, researchers relied on parameterized models of codon evolution. Here we present the first empirical codon substitution matrix entirely built from alignments of coding sequences from vertebrate DNA and thus provide an alternative to parameterized models of codon evolution. RESULTS: A set of 17,502 alignments of orthologous sequences from five vertebrate genomes yielded 8.3 million aligned codons from which the number of substitutions between codons were counted. From this data, both a probability matrix and a matrix of similarity scores were computed. They are 64 x 64 matrices describing the substitutions between all codons. Substitutions from sense codons to stop codons are not considered, resulting in block diagonal matrices consisting of 61 x 61 entries for the sense codons and 3 x 3 entries for the stop codons. CONCLUSION: The amount of genomic data currently available allowed for the construction of an empirical codon substitution matrix. However, more sequence data is still needed to construct matrices from different subsets of DNA, specific to kingdoms, evolutionary distance or different amount of synonymous change. Codon mutation matrices have advantages for alignments up to medium evolutionary distances and for usages that require DNA such as ancestral reconstruction of DNA sequences and the calculation of Ka/Ks ratios.},

Addressing this need, we introduce open-source methods for long-read alignment (NGMLR; https://github.com/philres/ngmlr) and structural variant identification (Sniffles; https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles) that provide unprecedented sensitivity and precision for variant detection, even in repeat-rich regions and for complex nested events that can have substantial effects on human health. In several long-read datasets, including healthy and cancerous human genomes, we discovered thousands of novel variants and categorized systematic errors in short-read approaches. NGMLR and Sniffles can automatically filter false events and operate on low-coverage data, thereby reducing the high costs that have hindered the application of long reads in clinical and research settings.},

@article{seoigheModelDirectionalSelection2007,
  abstract     = {Understanding how pathogens acquire resistance to drugs is important for the design of treatment strategies, particularly for rapidly evolving viruses such as HIV-1. Drug treatment can exert strong selective pressures and sites within targeted genes that confer resistance frequently evolve far more rapidly than the neutral rate. Rapid evolution at sites that confer resistance to drugs can be used to help elucidate the mechanisms of evolution of drug resistance and to discover or corroborate novel resistance mutations. We have implemented standard maximum likelihood methods that are used to detect diversifying selection and adapted them for use with serially sampled reverse transcriptase (RT) coding sequences isolated from a group of 300 HIV-1 subtype C–infected women before and after single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP) to prevent mother-to-child transmission. We have also extended the standard models of codon evolution for application to the detection of directional selection. Through simulation, we show that the directional selection model can provide a substantial improvement in sensitivity over models of diversifying selection. Five of the sites within the RT gene that are known to harbor mutations that confer resistance to nevirapine (NVP) strongly supported the directional selection model. There was no evidence that other mutations that are known to confer NVP resistance were selected in this cohort. The directional selection model, applied to serially sampled sequences, also had more power than the diversifying selection model to detect selection resulting from factors other than drug resistance. Because inference of selection from serial samples is unlikely to be adversely affected by recombination, the methods we describe may have general applicability to the analysis of positive selection affecting recombining coding sequences when serially sampled data are available.},

Here, we describe the origins and evolution of these viruses, and the circumstances that led to the AIDS pandemic. Both HIVs are the result of multiple cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) naturally infecting African primates. Most of these transfers resulted in viruses that spread in humans to only a limited extent. However, one transmission event, involving SIVcpz from chimpanzees in southeastern Cameroon, gave rise to HIV-1 group M—the principal cause of the AIDS pandemic. We discuss how host restriction factors have shaped the emergence of new SIV zoonoses by imposing adaptive hurdles to cross-species transmission and/or secondary spread. We also show that AIDS has likely afflicted chimpanzees long before the emergence of HIV. Tracing the genetic changes that occurred as SIVs crossed from monkeys to apes and from apes to humans provides a new framework to examine the requirements of successful host switches and to gauge future zoonotic risk., Approximately one century ago in southeastern Cameroon, cross-species transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees gave rise to HIV-1 group M, the principal cause of the AIDS pandemic in humans.},

@article{shawHIVTransmission2012,
  abstract     = {HIV-1 is transmitted by sexual contact across mucosal surfaces, by maternal-infant exposure, and by percutaneous inoculation. For reasons that are still incompletely understood, CCR5-tropic viruses (R5 viruses) are preferentially transmitted by all routes. Transmission is followed by an orderly appearance of viral and host markers of infection in the blood plasma. In the acute phase of infection, HIV-1 replicates exponentially and diversifies randomly, allowing for an unambiguous molecular identification of transmitted/founder virus genomes and a precise characterization of the population bottleneck to virus transmission. Sexual transmission of HIV-1 most often results in productive clinical infection arising from a single virus, highlighting the extreme bottleneck and inherent inefficiency in virus transmission. It remains to be determined if HIV-1 transmission is largely a stochastic process whereby any reasonably fit R5 virus can be transmitted or if there are features of transmitted/founder viruses that facilitate their transmission in a biologically meaningful way. Human tissue explant models of HIV-1 infection and animal models of SIV/SHIV/HIV-1 transmission, coupled with new challenge virus strains that more closely reflect transmitted/founder viruses, have the potential to elucidate fundamental mechanisms in HIV-1 transmission relevant to vaccine design and other prevention strategies.},

Little is known about the response of higher eukaryotes to chronic loss of ribosomal accuracy as per an increase in the random error rate of mRNA decoding. Here, we present a global and comprehensive picture of the cellular changes in response to translational accuracy in mammalian ribosomes impaired by genetic manipulation. In addition to affecting established protein quality control pathways, such as elevated transcript levels for cytosolic chaperones, activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and translational slowdown, ribosomal mistranslation led to unexpected responses. In particular, we observed increased mitochondrial biogenesis associated with import of misfolded proteins into the mitochondria and silencing of the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum.},

Over the past three years, massively parallel DNA sequencing platforms have become widely available, reducing the cost of DNA sequencing by over two orders of magnitude, and democratizing the field by putting the sequencing capacity of a major genome center in the hands of individual investigators. These new technologies are rapidly evolving, and near-term challenges include the development of robust protocols for generating sequencing libraries, building effective new approaches to data-analysis, and often a rethinking of experimental design.

Here, using a large-scale meta-transcriptomic approach, we discover 214 vertebrate-associated viruses in reptiles, amphibians, lungfish, ray-finned fish, cartilaginous fish and jawless fish. The newly discovered viruses appear in every family or genus of RNA virus associated with vertebrate infection, including those containing human pathogens such as influenza virus, the Arenaviridae and Filoviridae families, and have branching orders that broadly reflected the phylogenetic history of their hosts. We establish a long evolutionary history for most groups of vertebrate RNA virus, and support this by evaluating evolutionary timescales using dated orthologous endogenous virus elements. We also identify new vertebrate-specific RNA viruses and genome architectures, and re-evaluate the evolution of vector-borne RNA viruses.

We have implemented a set of queries and database sequences and proceeded to test and compare various similarity search methods and their parameterizations. We demonstrate here that the Smith–Waterman (S-W) dynamic programming method and the optimized version of FASTA are significantly better able to distinguish true similarities from statistical noise than is the popular database search tool BLAST. Also, a simple “log-length normalization” of S-W scores based on the query and target sequence lengths greatly increased the selectivity of the S-W searches, exceeding the default normalization method of FASTA. An implementation of the modified S-W algorithm in hardware (the Fast Data Finder) is able to match the accuracy of software versions while greatly speeding up its execution. We present here the selectivity and sensitivity data from these tests as well as results for various scoring matrices. We present data that will help users to choose threshold score values for evaluation of database search results. We also illustrate the impact of using simple-sequence masking tools such as SEG or XNU.},

NNRTI hypersusceptibility has been associated with improved outcomes to NNRTI-based therapy.         Objective:\~         To determine the genetic correlates of efavirenz hypersusceptibility.         Methods:\~         Paired baseline genotypes and phenotypes were obtained from 444 NRTI-experienced, NNRTI-naive patients. Fisher's exact tests, recursive partitioning (classification and regression trees; CART), and stepwise binary regression were used to identify specific reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations associated with efavirenz hypersusceptibility.         Results:\~         In univariate analyses, 26 RT codons were associated with efavirenz hypersusceptibility (P {$<$} 0.05), the top five were 215 {$>$} 41 {$>$} 210 {$>$} 118 {$>$} 208 (all P {$<$} 0.000001). From stepwise model selection, the 215, 208 and 118 mutations remained independently predictive of efavirenz hypersusceptibility. A final binary regression model to predict efavirenz hypersusceptibility included one covariate for the 215 mutation (relative risk 2.6, P {$<$} 0.0001) and a second covariate representing either the 208 or 118 mutation (relative risk 1.8, P {$<$} 0.0001). Similarly, in a CART analysis, a mutation at codon 215 was the first split selected, followed by mutations at 208 and 118. An efavirenz hypersusceptibility genotypic score using the three mutations 208, 118 and 215 was as accurate at predicting efavirenz hypersusceptibility as a more complex scoring system using 26 mutations.         Conclusion:\~         Mutations at 215, 208 and 118 were independently associated with NNRTI hypersusceptibility. After confirmatory studies using other large datasets, incorporating a hypersusceptibility score into genotype interpretation algorithms will improve the prediction of NNRTI hypersusceptibility.},

These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

@article{silvaInhibitionCatalyticMechanism1996,
  abstract     = {The structure of the HIV-1 protease in complex with a pseudo-C2 symmetric inhibitor, which contains a central difluoroketone motif, has been determined with X-ray diffraction data extending to 1.7 Å resolution. The electron density map clearly indicates that the inhibitor is bound in a symmetric fashion as the hydrated, or gemdiol, form of the difluoroketone. Refinement of the complex reveals a unique, and almost symmetric, set of interactions between the geminal hydroxyl groups, the geminal fluorine atoms, and the active-site aspartate residues. Several hydrogen bonding patterns are consistent with that conformation. The lowest energy hydrogen disposition, as determined by semiempirical energy calculations, shows only one active site aspartate protonated. A comparison between the corresponding dihedral angles of the difluorodiol core and those of a hydrated peptide bond analog, calculated ab-initio, shows that the inhibitor core is a mimic of a hydrated peptide bond in a gauche conformation. The feasibility of an anti-gauche transition for a peptide bond after hydration is verified by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations suggest that rotation about the C-N scissile bond would readily occur after hydration and would be driven by the optimization of the interactions of peptide side-chains with the enzyme. These results, together with the characterization of a transition state leading to bond breakage via a concerted exchange of two protons, suggest a proteolysis mechanism whereby only one active site aspartate is initially protonated. The steps of this mechanism are: asymmetric binding of the substrate; hydration of the peptidic carbonyl by an active site water; proton translocation between the active site aspartate residues simultaneously with carbonyl hydration; optimization of the binding of the entire substrate facilitated by the flexible structure of the hydrated peptide bond, which, in turn, forces the hydrated peptide bond to assume a gauche conformation; simultaneous proton exchange whereby one hydroxyl donates a proton to the charged aspartate, and, at the same time, the nitrogen lone pair accepts a proton from the other aspartate; and, bond breakage and regeneration of the initial protonation state of the aspartate residues.},

@article{simmondsVariabilityHepatitisVirus1995,
  abstract     = {“What I cannot create, I do not understand.” Richard Feynman may have championed reasoning from first principles in his famous blackboard missive, but he could just as well have been referring to the plight of a molecular virologist. What cannot be grown in a controlled laboratory setting, we cannot fully understand. The story of the laboratory domestication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is now a classic example of virologists applying all manner of inventive skill to create cell-based models of infection in order to clarify prospective drug targets. In this review, we highlight key successes and failures that were instructive in achieving cell-based models for HCV studies and drug development. We also emphasize the lessons learned from the ∼40 year saga that may be applicable to viruses yet unknown and uncultured. Simeprevir (Olysio®), a second-wave protease inhibitor recently approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, is not indicated in patients with genotype 1a strain harboring the Q80K protease mutation. Phase 2 and 3 studies on this molecule mainly focused on North American patients and the prevalence of Q80K is particularly high in the USA (around 50\%). The prevalence of this mutation in other parts of the world is currently unknown. The purpose of our study was to perform a detection of this mutation in a single PCR technique and to study the prevalence of this Q80K mutation in a non U.S. population. We can thus estimate the proportion of HCV positive patients who can be treated with simeprevir. We conducted a meta-analysis of response rates in the presence or absence of this mutation in randomized trials and then describe a simple and reliable method to detect this mutation. We also examined bilirubin levels in our cohort of 95 HCV genotype 1a patients. Ten patients (10.5\%) had a Q80K mutation and 12 patients exhibited bilirubin levels above the upper limit of normal at baseline. In our cohort, 21 patients (22\%) were therefore ineligible for treatment with simeprevir. The prevalence of this mutation seems to be much lower in European patients. In conclusion, before considering treatment with simeprevir, physicians must be able to screen for the Q80K mutation. The adaptation of the overall codon usage pattern of hepatitis C virus (HCV) to that of human is estimated by the synonymous codon usage value (RSCU). The synonymous codon usage biases for the translation initiation region (TIR) of this virus are also analyzed by calculation of usage fluctuation of each synonymous codon along the TIR (the first 30 codon sites of the whole coding sequence of HCV). As for the overall codon usage pattern of HCV, this virus has a significant tendency to delete the codons with CpG or TpA dinucleotides. Turning to the adaptation of the overall codon usage of HCV to that of human, over half part of codons has a similar usage pattern between this virus and human, suggesting that the host cellular environment of the overall codon usage pattern influences the formation of codon usage for HCV. In addition, there is no obvious phenomenon that the codons with relatively low energy tend to be highly selected in the TIR of HCV, suggesting that the synonymous codon usage patterns for the TIR of HCV might be not affected by the secondary structure of nucleotide sequence, however, the formation of synonymous codons usage in the TIR of HCV is influenced by the overall codon usage patterns of human to some degree.},

  abstract     = {HIV-1 protease site helps to understand the specificity of substrates which antagonizes AIDS by restraining the replication of HIV-1 through inhibitors. Identification of HIV-1 protease cleavage sites by experimental methods are usually labor-intensive thus time-consuming. Several computational intelligence methods have been evaluated to predict cleavage sites. However, due to inconsistent findings regarding the superiority of one classifier over another and the usefulness of encoding techniques in general, more research is needed to provide advance confidence in computational results. The success of an HIV cleavage site prediction system depends heavily on two things: the classifier being used and the features encoding technique applied. For the cleavage sites identification, the role of appropriate feature encoding has not been paid adequate importance. In this investigation, we use two novel ideas for HIV Cleavage site prediction. First, we propose an optimal ensemble formation technique that optimizes the search space of 228 formed by seven encoding techniques and four SVM kernels (7\\,× \\,4 ) with the use of genetic algorithm. The second is the utilization of area under receiver operating characteristics (AUC) as a fitness measure for the evaluation of optimal ensemble. The evolutionary algorithm is encoded with binary strings to decide the correlation between the encoding-classifier pair in an ensemble. The proposed method with new ensembling encoding-classifier pair increases the HIV cleavage site prediction significantly. Overall, an appealing degree of predictive accuracy is observed by evolutionary-based ensemble model and hence becomes a valid and best alternative for peptide classification.},

  abstract     = {As the protein databases continue to expand at an exponential rate, fed by daily uploads from multiple large scale genomic and metagenomic projects, the problem of assigning a function to each new protein has become the focus of significant research interest in recent times. Herein, we review the most recent advances in the field of automated function prediction (AFP). We begin by defining what is meant by biological “function” and the means of describing such functions using standardised machine readable ontologies. We then focus on the various function-prediction programs available, both sequence and structure based, and outline their associated strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we conclude with a brief overview of the future challenges and outstanding questions in the field, which still remain unanswered.},

@article{sluis-cremerMolecularMechanismsHIV12000,
  abstract     = {Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine, 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine and 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine, are effective inhibitors of human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) replication. NRTIs are deoxynucleoside triphosphate analogs, but lack a free 3′-hydroxyl group. Once NRTIs are incorporated into the nascent viral DNA, in reactions catalyzed by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), further viral DNA synthesis is effectively terminated. NRTIs should therefore represent the ideal antiviral agent. Unfortunately, HIV-1 inevitably develops resistance to these inhibitors, and this resistance correlates with mutations in RT. To date, three phenotypic mechanisms have been identified or proposed to account for HIV-1 RT resistance to NRTIs. These mechanisms include alterations of RT discrimination between NRTIs and the analogous dNTP (direct effects on NRTI binding and/or incorporation), alterations in RT-template/primer interactions, which may influence subsequent NRTI incorporation, and enhanced removal of the chain-terminating residue from the 3′ end of the primer. These different resistance phenotypes seem to correlate with different sets of mutations in RT. This review discusses the relationship between HIV-1 drug resistance genotype and phenotype, in relation to our current knowledge of HIV-1 RT structure.},

@article{smithIdentificationCommonMolecular1981,
  abstract     = {Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction performs a crucial part in drug discovery and design. Although many computational approaches for such prediction have been proposed, current researches still generally adopt chemical similarities of drugs or the sequence similarities of targets. However, the valuable information of known interactions has not been noticed, and the existing noise and useless information reduce the accuracy of DTI prediction. In addition, many existing computational approaches ignore the behavior information between nodes of the DTI network. In this paper, we develop an ensemble computational approach called integrated multi-similarity fusion and heterogeneous graph inference. First, based on the known DTI network, the degree distribution of drug and target similarities are analyzed and the noise and useless information are removed to improve prediction accuracy. Second, based on drug and target similarities and known DTIs, a strategy of multi-similarity fusion is proposed to capture potential useful information from known interactions that is used for enhancing drug and target similarities. Third, the heterogeneous graph inference is used to predict the DTIs to capture the edge weight (closeness) and behavior information (diffusion) between nodes of a heterogeneous network. To assist the reproducibility of our work and its comparison to published results, we perform experiments on four benchmark datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms some existing approaches and can contribute to predicting potential DTIs. The fundamental role of microRNAs (miRNAs) has long been associated with regulation of gene expression during transcription and post transcription of mRNA's 3′UTR by the RNA interference mechanism. Also, the process of how miRNAs tend to induce mRNA degradation has been predominantly studied in many infectious diseases. In this article, we would like to discuss the interaction of dietary plant miRNAs derived from fresh fruits against the viral genome of the causative agent of COVID-19, specifically targeting the 3′UTR of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) genome. Expanding the analysis, we have also identified plant miRNAs that interact against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2 across 37 countries/territories throughout the world. This cross-species virus-plant interaction led us to identify the alignment of dietary plant miRNAs found in fruits like Citrus sinensis (Orange), Prunus persica (Peaches), Vitis vinifera (Grapes) and Malus domestica (Apple) onto the viral genomes. In particular, the interaction of C. sinensis miRNA - csi-miR169–3p and SARS-CoV-2 is noteworthy, as the targeted 3′UTR region “CTGCCT” is found conserved amongst all curated 772 Omicron variants across the globe. Hence this site “CTGCCT” and miRNA csi-miR169–3p may become promising therapeutic candidates to induce viral genome silencing. Thereby, this study reveals the mechanistic way of how fruits tend to enact a fight against viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and aid in maintaining a strong immune system of an individual. The reductive glycine pathway was described as the most energetically favorable synthetic route of aerobic formate assimilation. Here we report the successful implementation of formatotrophy in Escherichia coli by means of a stepwise adaptive evolution strategy. Medium swap and turbidostat regimes of continuous culture were applied to force the channeling of carbon flux through the synthetic pathway to pyruvate establishing growth on formate and CO2 as sole carbon sources. Labeling with 13C-formate proved the assimilation of the C1 substrate via the pathway metabolites. Genetic analysis of intermediate isolates revealed a mutational path followed throughout the adaptation process. Mutations were detected affecting the copy number (gene ftfL) or the coding sequence (genes folD and lpd) of genes which specify enzymes implicated in the three steps forming glycine from formate and CO2, the central metabolite of the synthetic pathway. The mutation R191S present in methylene-tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase (FolD) abolishes the inhibition of cyclohydrolase activity by the substrate formyl-tetrahydrofolate. The mutation R273H in lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd) alters substrate affinities as well as kinetics at physiological substrate concentrations likely favoring a reactional shift towards lipoamide reduction. In addition, genetic reconstructions proved the necessity of all three mutations for formate assimilation by the adapted cells. The largely unpredictable nature of these changes demonstrates the usefulness of the evolutionary approach enabling the selection of adaptive mutations crucial for pathway engineering of biotechnological model organisms. Expression of mRNA is often regulated by the binding of a small RNA (miRNA, snoRNA, siRNA). While the pairing contribution to the net free energy is well parameterized and can be computed in O(N){$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}O{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}N{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} time, the cost of removing pre-existing mRNA secondary structure has not received sufficient attention. Conventional methods for computing the unfolding free energy of a target mRNA are costly, scaling like the cube of the number of target bases O(N3){$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}O{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}N{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}3{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}. Here we introduce a model to describe the unfolding costs of the binding site, which features surprisingly big differences in the free energy parameters for the four bases. The model is implemented in our O(N){$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}O{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}N{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} algorithm, BindOligoNet. Donor splice site prediction is more accurate when using our calculation of spliceosomal U1-snRNA to mRNA net binding free energy. Our base-dependent free energies also correlate with efficient ribosome docking near the start codon.},

@article{sodingProteinHomologyDetection2005,
  abstract     = {MOTIVATION: Protein homology detection and sequence alignment are at the basis of protein structure prediction, function prediction and evolution. RESULTS: We have generalized the alignment of protein sequences with a profile hidden Markov model (HMM) to the case of pairwise alignment of profile HMMs. We present a method for detecting distant homologous relationships between proteins based on this approach. The method (HHsearch) is benchmarked together with BLAST, PSI-BLAST, HMMER and the profile-profile comparison tools PROF\_SIM and COMPASS, in an all-against-all comparison of a database of 3691 protein domains from SCOP 1.63 with pairwise sequence identities below 20\%.Sensitivity: When the predicted secondary structure is included in the HMMs, HHsearch is able to detect between 2.7 and 4.2 times more homologs than PSI-BLAST or HMMER and between 1.44 and 1.9 times more than COMPASS or PROF\_SIM for a rate of false positives of 10\%. Approximately half of the improvement over the profile-profile comparison methods is attributable to the use of profile HMMs in place of simple profiles. Alignment quality: Higher sensitivity is mirrored by an increased alignment quality. HHsearch produced 1.2, 1.7 and 3.3 times more good alignments ('balanced' score {$>$}0.3) than the next best method (COMPASS), and 1.6, 2.9 and 9.4 times more than PSI-BLAST, at the family, superfamily and fold level, respectively.Speed: HHsearch scans a query of 200 residues against 3691 domains in 33 s on an AMD64 2GHz PC. This is 10 times faster than PROF\_SIM and 17 times faster than COMPASS.},

In this review, we categorize de novo assemblers on the basis of the type of de Bruijn graphs (Hamiltonian and Eulerian) and discuss the challenges of de novo assembly for short NGS reads regarding computational complexity and assembly ambiguity. Then, we discuss how the limitations of the short reads can be overcome by using a single-molecule sequencing platform that generates long reads of up to several kilobases. In fact, the long read assembly has caused a paradigm shift in whole-genome assembly in terms of algorithms and supporting steps. We also summarize (i) hybrid assemblies using both short and long reads and (ii) overlap-based assemblies for long reads and discuss their challenges and future prospects. This review provides guidelines to determine the optimal approach for a given input data type, computational budget or genome.},

In recent years, pretraining models that have emerged in natural language processing have attracted widespread attention in many research fields not only to decrease training cost but also to improve performance on downstream tasks. Pretraining models are used for embedding biological sequence and extracting feature from large biological sequence corpus to comprehensively understand the biological sequence data. In this survey, we provide a broad review on pretraining models for biological sequence data. Moreover, we first introduce biological sequences and corresponding datasets, including brief description and accessible link. Subsequently, we systematically summarize popular pretraining models for biological sequences based on four categories: CNN, word2vec, LSTM and Transformer. Then, we present some applications with proposed pretraining models on downstream tasks to explain the role of pretraining models. Next, we provide a novel pretraining scheme for protein sequences and a multitask benchmark for protein pretraining models.

Dynamic programming algorithms are generally, well-suited to such problems, but can be slow and require too much storage if the lattice is too large, for example, if the lattice dimension is too high. Faster algorithms requiring less computer storage can often be constructed by restricting calculations to a “computational volume” known to contain the optimal path.

Consensus barcodes are overall mismatch-free but retain indel errors that are concentrated in homopolymeric regions. They are addressed with an optional error correction pipeline that is based on conserved amino acid motifs from publicly available barcodes. The effectiveness of this pipeline is documented by analysing reads from three MinION™ runs that represent three different stages of MinION™ development. They generated data for (i) 511 specimens of a mixed Diptera sample, (ii) 575 specimens of ants and (iii) 50 specimens of Chironomidae. The run based on the latest chemistry yielded MinION™ barcodes for 490 of the 511 specimens which were assessed against reference Sanger barcodes (N = 471). Overall, the MinION™ barcodes have an accuracy of 99.3\%–100\% with the number of ambiguous bases after correction ranging from {$<$}0.01\% to 1.5\% depending on which correction pipeline is used. We demonstrate that it requires 2 hr of sequencing to gather all information needed for obtaining reliable barcodes for most specimens ({$>$}90\%). We estimate that up to 1,000 barcodes can be generated in one flow cell and that the cost per barcode can be},

  abstract     = {The Bioperl project is an international open-source collaboration of biologists, bioinformaticians, and computer scientists that has evolved over the past 7 yr into the most comprehensive library of Perl modules available for managing and manipulating life-science information. Bioperl provides an easy-to-use, stable, and consistent programming interface for bioinformatics application programmers. The Bioperl modules have been successfully and repeatedly used to reduce otherwise complex tasks to only a few lines of code. The Bioperl object model has been proven to be flexible enough to support enterprise-level applications such as EnsEMBL, while maintaining an easy learning curve for novice Perl programmers. Bioperl is capable of executing analyses and processing results from programs such as BLAST, ClustalW, or the EMBOSS suite. Interoperation with modules written in Python and Java is supported through the evolving BioCORBA bridge. Bioperl provides access to data stores such as GenBank and SwissProt via a flexible series of sequence input/output modules, and to the emerging common sequence data storage format of the Open Bioinformatics Database Access project. This study describes the overall architecture of the toolkit, the problem domains that it addresses, and gives specific examples of how the toolkit can be used to solve common life-sciences problems. We conclude with a discussion of how the open-source nature of the project has contributed to the development effort. [Supplemental material is available online at www.genome.org.

@article{stapletonGBVirusesReview2011,
  abstract     = {In 1967, it was reported that experimental inoculation of serum from a surgeon (G.B.) with acute hepatitis into tamarins resulted in hepatitis. In 1995, two new members of the family Flaviviridae, named GBV-A and GBV-B, were identified in tamarins that developed hepatitis following inoculation with the 11th GB passage. Neither virus infects humans, and a number of GBV-A variants were identified in wild New World monkeys that were captured. Subsequently, a related human virus was identified [named GBV-C or hepatitis G virus (HGV)], and recently a more distantly related virus (named GBV-D) was discovered in bats. Only GBV-B, a second species within the genus Hepacivirus (type species hepatitis C virus), has been shown to cause hepatitis; it causes acute hepatitis in experimentally infected tamarins. The other GB viruses have however not been assigned to a genus within the family Flaviviridae. Based on phylogenetic relationships, genome organization and pathogenic features of the GB viruses, we propose to classify GBV-A-like viruses, GBV-C and GBV-D as members of a fourth genus in the family Flaviviridae, named Pegivirus (pe, persistent; g, GB or G). We also propose renaming ‘GB’ viruses within the tentative genus Pegivirus to reflect their host origin.},

@article{steinerDrugResistancePrediction2020,
  abstract     = {The fast replication rate and lack of repair mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) contribute to its high mutation frequency, with some mutations resulting in the evolution of resistance to antiretroviral therapies (ART). As such, studying HIV drug resistance allows for real-time evaluation of evolutionary mechanisms. Characterizing the biological process of drug resistance is also critically important for sustained effectiveness of ART. Investigating the link between \&ldquo;black box\&rdquo; deep learning methods applied to this problem and evolutionary principles governing drug resistance has been overlooked to date. Here, we utilized publicly available HIV-1 sequence data and drug resistance assay results for 18 ART drugs to evaluate the performance of three architectures (multilayer perceptron, bidirectional recurrent neural network, and convolutional neural network) for drug resistance prediction, jointly with biological analysis. We identified convolutional neural networks as the best performing architecture and displayed a correspondence between the importance of biologically relevant features in the classifier and overall performance. Our results suggest that the high classification performance of deep learning models is indeed dependent on drug resistance mutations (DRMs). These models heavily weighted several features that are not known DRM locations, indicating the utility of model interpretability to address causal relationships in viral genotype-phenotype data.},

  abstract     = {Sequencing technology has achieved great advances in the past decade. Studies have previously shown the quality of specific instruments in controlled conditions. Here, we developed a method able to retroactively determine the error rate of most public sequencing datasets. To do this, we utilized the overlaps between reads that are a feature of many sequencing libraries. With this method, we surveyed 1943 different datasets from seven different sequencing instruments produced by Illumina. We show that among public datasets, the more expensive platforms like HiSeq and NovaSeq have a lower error rate and less variation. But we also discovered that there is great variation within each platform, with the accuracy of a sequencing experiment depending greatly on the experimenter. We show the importance of sequence context, especially the phenomenon where preceding bases bias the following bases toward the same identity. We also show the difference in patterns of sequence bias between instruments. Contrary to expectations based on the underlying chemistry, HiSeq X Ten and NovaSeq 6000 share notable exceptions to the preceding-base bias. Our results demonstrate the importance of the specific circumstances of every sequencing experiment, and the importance of evaluating the quality of each one.},

Recent deep-learning approaches to protein prediction have shown that pre-training on unlabeled data can yield useful representations for downstream tasks. However, the optimal pre-training strategy remains an open question. Instead of strictly borrowing from natural language processing (NLP) in the form of masked or autoregressive language modeling, we introduce a new pre-training task: directly predicting protein profiles derived from multiple sequence alignments. Using a set of five, standardized downstream tasks for protein models, we demonstrate that our pre-training task along with a multi-task objective outperforms masked language modeling alone on all five tasks. Our results suggest that protein sequence models may benefit from leveraging biologically-inspired inductive biases that go beyond existing language modeling techniques in NLP.},

Viruses infecting fungi and oomycetes are characterized by persistent intracellular nonlytic lifestyles and transmission via spores and/or hyphal contacts. Almost all fungal and oomycete viruses have genomes composed of single-stranded or double-stranded RNA, and recent studies have revealed numerous novel viruses representing yet unclassified family-level groups. Depending on the virus–host combination, infections can be asymptomatic, beneficial or detrimental to the host. Thus, mycovirus infections may contribute to the multiplex interactions of hosts, therefore likely affecting the dynamics of fungal communities required for the functioning of soil ecosystems. However, the effects of fungal and oomycete viruses on soil ecological processes are still mostly unknown.

Non-redundancy and intra-cluster homogeneity in UniRef were recently improved by adding a sequence length overlap threshold. Our hypothesis is that these improvements would enhance the speed and sensitivity of similarity searches and improve the consistency of annotation within clusters.Results: Intra-cluster molecular function consistency was examined by analysis of Gene Ontology terms. Results show that UniRef clusters bring together proteins of identical molecular function in more than 97\% of the clusters, implying that clusters are useful for annotation and can also be used to detect annotation inconsistencies. To examine coverage in similarity results, BLASTP searches against UniRef50 followed by expansion of the hit lists with cluster members demonstrated advantages compared with searches against UniProtKB sequences; the searches are concise (∼7 times shorter hit list before expansion), faster (∼6 times) and more sensitive in detection of remote similarities (\&gt;96\% recall at e-value \&lt;0.0001). Our results support the use of UniRef clusters as a comprehensive and scalable alternative to native sequence databases for similarity searches and reinforces its reliability for use in functional annotation.Availability and implementation: Web access and file download from UniProt website at http://www.uniprot.org/uniref and ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/uniref.

@article{tamposisSemisupervisedLearningHidden2019,
  abstract     = {Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are probabilistic models widely used in applications in computational sequence analysis. HMMs are basically unsupervised models. However, in the most important applications, they are trained in a supervised manner. Training examples accompanied by labels corresponding to different classes are given as input and the set of parameters that maximize the joint probability of sequences and labels is estimated. A main problem with this approach is that, in the majority of the cases, labels are hard to find and thus the amount of training data is limited. On the other hand, there are plenty of unclassified (unlabeled) sequences deposited in the public databases that could potentially contribute to the training procedure. This approach is called semi-supervised learning and could be very helpful in many applications.We propose here, a method for semi-supervised learning of HMMs that can incorporate labeled, unlabeled and partially labeled data in a straightforward manner. The algorithm is based on a variant of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, where the missing labels of the unlabeled or partially labeled data are considered as the missing data. We apply the algorithm to several biological problems, namely, for the prediction of transmembrane protein topology for alpha-helical and beta-barrel membrane proteins and for the prediction of archaeal signal peptides. The results are very promising, since the algorithms presented here can significantly improve the prediction performance of even the top-scoring classifiers.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation.

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

  abstract  = {While second generation sequencing led to a vast increase in sequenced data, the shorter reads which came with it made assembly a much harder task and for some regions impossible with only short read data. This changed again with the advent of third generation long read sequencers. The length of the long reads allows a much better resolution of repetitive regions, their high error rate however is a major challenge. Using the data successfully requires to remove most of the sequencing errors. The first hybrid correction methods used low noise second generation data to correct third generation data, but this approach has issues when it is unclear where to place the short reads due to repeats and also because second generation sequencers fail to sequence some regions which third generation sequencers work on. Later non hybrid methods appeared. We present a new method for non hybrid long read error correction based on De Bruijn graph assembly of short windows of long reads with subsequent combination of these correct windows to corrected long reads. Our experiments show that this method yields a better correction than other state of the art non hybrid correction approaches.},

  abstract  = {Despite an explosion in the number of experimentally determined, atomically detailed structures of biomolecules, many critical tasks in structural biology remain data-limited.  Whether performance in such tasks can be improved by using large repositories of tangentially related structural data remains an open question.  To address this question, we focused on a central problem in biology: predicting how proteins interact with one another—that is, which surfaces of one protein bind to those of another protein.  We built a training dataset, the Database of Interacting Protein Structures (DIPS), that contains biases but is two orders of magnitude larger than those used previously.  We found that these biases significantly degrade the performance of existing methods on gold-standard data.  Hypothesizing that assumptions baked into the hand-crafted features on which these methods depend were the source of the problem, we developed the first end-to-end learning model for protein interface prediction, the Siamese Atomic Surfacelet Network (SASNet).  Using only spatial coordinates and identities of atoms, SASNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods trained on gold-standard structural data, even when trained on only 3\% of our new dataset.

  abstract     = {An amino acid substitution scoring matrix encapsulates the rates at which various amino acid residues in proteins are substituted by other amino acid residues, over time. Database search methods make use of substitution scoring matrices to identify sequences with homologous relationships. However, widely used substitution scoring matrices, such as BLOSUM series, have been developed using aligned blocks that are mostly devoid of disordered regions in proteins. Hence, these substitution-scoring matrices are mostly inappropriate for homology searches involving proteins enriched with disordered regions as the disordered regions have distinct amino acid compositional bias, and therefore expected to have undergone amino acid substitutions that are distinct from those in the ordered regions. We, therefore, developed a novel series of substitution scoring matrices referred to as EDSSMat by exclusively considering the substitution frequencies of amino acids in the disordered regions of the eukaryotic proteins. The newly developed matrices were tested for their ability to detect homologs of proteins enriched with disordered regions by means of SSEARCH tool. The results unequivocally demonstrate that EDSSMat matrices detect more number of homologs than the widely used BLOSUM, PAM and other standard matrices, indicating their utility value for homology searches of intrinsically disordered proteins.},

Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold2, at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool\~that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},

  abstract     = {The MinION sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) is a paradigm shifting device allowing rapid, real time long read sequencing of nucleic acids. Yet external benchmarking of this technologies’ capabilities has not been extensively reported, nor has thorough evaluation of its utility for field-based analysis with sub-optimal sample types been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of the MinION sequencer for bacterial genomic and metagenomic applications, with specific emphasis placed on the quality, yield, and accuracy of generated sequence data. Two independent laboratories at the National Microbiology Laboratory (Public Health Agency of Canada), sequenced a set of microbes in replicate, using the currently available flowcells, sequencing chemistries, and software available at the time of the experiment. Overall sequencing yield and quality improved through the course of this set of experiments. Sequencing alignment accuracy was high reaching 97\% for all 2D experiments, though was slightly lower for 1D sequencing (94\%). 1D sequencing provided much longer sequences than 2D. Both sequencing chemistries performed equally well in constructing genomic assemblies. There was evidence of barcode cross-over using both the native and PCR barcoding methods. Despite the sub-optimal nature of samples sequenced in the field, sequences attributable to B. anthracis the target organism used in this scenario, could none-the-less be detected. Together, this report showcases the rapid advancement in this technology and its utility in the context of genomic sequencing of microbial isolates of importance to public health.},

  abstract     = {Objectives This paper describes the development of the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (CHIC) Study. The aim of the study is to collate routinely collected data on HIV-infected individuals attending one of seven clinical centres in the UK since 1 January 1996, with the objectives of describing changes over time in the frequency of AIDS-defining illnesses, describing the uptake of and response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and identifying factors associated with virological and immunological responses to HAART. Methods By December 2002, demographic, clinical and laboratory data had been collected on HIV-positive patients seen at six of the seven HIV centres. Missing and inconsistent data had been investigated and the datasets audited. Records identified as relating to the same patient had been merged, and cross-checks made with UK death registers to improve the accuracy of death reporting. Results The cohort currently contains information on 13 833 individuals. Eighty-two per cent of the cohort are male, and the median age was 34 years at first follow-up. The main risk factors for HIV infection have been determined as sex between men (63\%) and sex between men and women (24\%). Twenty-five per cent of the cohort are known to have developed AIDS, and 8\% have died. Conclusions The UK CHIC Study provides important information on the status of individuals infected with HIV in the UK, and provides a means to study the response to HAART and to monitor changes in the clinical event and death rates that have occurred since the introduction of HAART in the UK.},

  abstract     = {The problem of finding a longest common subsequence of two strings is discussed. This problem arises in data processing applications such as comparing two files and in genetic applications such as studying molecular evolution. The difficulty of computing a longest common subsequence of two strings is examined using the decision tree model of computation, in which vertices represent “equal - unequal” comparisons. It is shown that unless a bound on the total number of distinct symbols is assumed, every solution to the problem can consume an amount of time that is proportional to the product of the lengths of the two strings. A general lower bound as a function of the ratio of alphabet size to string length is derived. The case where comparisons between symbols of the same string are forbidden is also considered and it is shown that this problem is of linear complexity for a two-symbol alphabet and quadratic for an alphabet of three or more symbols.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The HIV-1 epidemic in West Africa is characterized by a slower rise than that in Eastern and Southern Africa. The HIV-2 epidemic in West Africa may be declining, but few long-term data exist. METHODS: In a research clinic in The Gambia, HIV-1 and HIV-2 prevalence trends among all new patients being tested for HIV were examined over a 16 year period (1988 till 2003). In newly diagnosed patients a baseline CD4 count was done. RESULTS: An HIV test was done in 23 363 patients aged 15 years or older. The prevalence of HIV-1 was 4.2\% in 1988-91 and rose to 17.5\% in 2001-03 (P {$<$} 0.0001, chi(2)-test for trend). The prevalence of HIV-2 was 7.0\% in 1988-91 and declined to 4.0\% in 2001-03 (P {$<$} 0.0001). HIV-1 prevalence increased and HIV-2 prevalence decreased with time in logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, and indication for test (P {$<$} 0.0001). Baseline CD4 counts were available for 65\% of patients. The median CD4 count was 215 cells/mm3 [interquartile range (IQR) 72-424] for HIV-1, and 274 (IQR 100-549) for HIV-2 infected patients. There was no marked trend of rise or decline in baseline CD4 count in either HIV-1 or HIV-2 infected patients over the study period. Forty-five per cent of newly diagnosed HIV patients had a CD4 count {$<$}200 cells/mm3. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that HIV-1 prevalence is rising in The Gambia, and that HIV-2 is declining. HIV patients in The Gambia present late and almost half of patients would qualify for anti-retroviral treatment at their first visit.},

Although traditionally recognized for their ability to invade and infect host cells, viruses and bacteriophages have been engineered over the past decade as highly promising molecular platforms for the targeted delivery and treatment of many human diseases. Inherently biodegradable, the outer capsids of viruses are composed entirely of protein building blocks, which can be genetically or chemically engineered with molecular imaging reagents, targeting ligands and therapeutic molecules. While there are several examples of viruses as in vitro molecular cargo carriers, their potential for applications in nanomedicine has only recently emerged.

  abstract     = {We explore the applicability of second generation sequencing (SGS) to sequence multiplexed forensic STR amplicons, both in a single contributor sample as in multiple-person mixtures with different ratios. We compare the results of a commercial STR profiling kit (Applied Biosystems AmpFlSTR® Profiler Plus®), analyzed both with capillary electrophoresis and with Roche GS FLX sequencing. An easy to use open-source software pipeline is provided, chaining together the different steps needed to start the analysis from a GS FLX FASTA file, resulting in a FASTA file containing the called and quantified alleles present in the data. Sequencing of multiplexed STR amplicons using Roche GS FLX titanium technology is technically feasible but the technology is not ideal for this purpose. The fraction of full length reads is small and the homopolymer sequencing error rate is high. The pipeline compresses the homopolymers to a single base to avoid false results caused by these homopolymers. The qualitative and quantitative results from the SGS STR analysis pipeline are comparable to the electrophoresis method. Additionally, the SGS method provides extra information and is able to call allele subtypes based on STR sequences in a database. In mixed samples, all alleles were reported from individuals that contributed at least 10\% to the mixture.},

@article{verhofstedeDetectionDrugResistance2007,
  abstract     = {In order to evaluate the usefulness of resistance testing after a viral rebound with plasma HIV RNA levels of less than 1,000 copies (c)/ml, genotyping was performed on 39 samples from patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) showing a viremia of over 50 c/ml up to a maximum of 1,000 c/ml after at least one undetectable viral load result. Protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences were obtained for all 39 samples. In 10 (25.6\%) of the samples, mutations not seen before the initiation of the regimen were observed. The M184V/I mutation was the most prevalent but in several patients a combination of multiple mutations was detected. Follow-up samples were available for 34 patients. In six (85.71\%) out of seven patients with new mutations, the viral load on the follow-up visit remained detectable, indicating true failure, compared to 6 (31.6\%) true failures out of 19 patients in whom only wild type virus was detected (P = 0.02) and three (37.5\%) out of eight patients in whom only the mutations already present at the initiation of HAART were seen (P = 0.08). The results indicate that reliable resistance testing can be performed on samples with a viral burden of less than 1,000 c/ml and demonstrate that multiple drug resistance mutations can be selected at low viral load rebounds. Most importantly, detection of resistance mutations in viral rebound samples was predictive of subsequent virological failure. J. Med.

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study was to document the genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC; formerly Zaire). A total of 247 HIV-1-positive samples, collected during an epidemiologic survey conducted in 1997 in three regions (Kinshasa [the capital], Bwamanda [in the north], and Mbuyi-Maya [in the south]), were genetically characterized in the env V3-V5 region. All known subtypes were found to cocirculate, and for 6\% of the samples the subtype could not be identified. Subtype A is predominant, with prevalences decreasing from north to south (69\% in the north, 53\% in the capital city, and 46\% in the south). Subtype C, D, G, and H prevalences range from 7 to 9\%, whereas subtype F, J, K, and CRF01-AE strains represent 2 to 4\% of the samples; only one subtype B strain was identified. The highest prevalence (25\%) of subtype C was in the south, and CRF01-AE was seen mainly in the north. The high intersubtype variability among the V3-V5 sequences is the most probable reason for the low (45\%) efficiency of subtype A-specific PCR and HMA (heteroduplex mobility assay). Eighteen (29\%) of 62 samples had discordant subtype designations between env and gag. Sequence analysis of the entire envelope from 13 samples confirmed the high degree of diversity and complexity of HIV-1 strains in the DRC; 9 had a complex recombinant structure in gp160, involving fragments of known and unknown subtypes. Interestingly, the unknown fragments from the different strains did not cluster together. Overall, the high number of HIV-1 subtypes cocirculating, the high intrasubtype diversity, and the high numbers of possible recombinant viruses as well as different unclassified strains are all in agreement with an old and mature epidemic in the DRC, suggesting that this region is the epicenter of HIV-1 group M.},

HIV infection in humans is caused by two related yet distinct viruses: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-2 is typically less virulent than HIV-1 and permits the host to mount a more effective and sustained T-cell immunity. Although both infections manifest the same clinical spectrum, the much lower rate of CD4+ T-cell decline and slower progression of disease in HIV-2 infected individuals have grabbed the attention of several researchers. Here, we review the most recent findings on the differential rate of decline of CD4+ T-cell in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections and provide plausible reasons for the observed differences between the two groups.},

  abstract      = {Transformer architectures have proven to learn useful representations for protein classification and generation tasks. However, these representations present challenges in interpretability. In this work, we demonstrate a set of methods for analyzing protein Transformer models through the lens of attention. We show that attention: (1) captures the folding structure of proteins, connecting amino acids that are far apart in the underlying sequence, but spatially close in the three-dimensional structure, (2) targets binding sites, a key functional component of proteins, and (3) focuses on progressively more complex biophysical properties with increasing layer depth. We find this behavior to be consistent across three Transformer architectures (BERT, ALBERT, XLNet) and two distinct protein datasets.

@article{villabona-arenasIndepthAnalysisHIV12016,
  abstract     = {Objective:\~In resource-limited countries, antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been scaled up, but individual monitoring is still suboptimal. Here, we studied whether or not ART had an impact on the frequency and selection of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) under these settings. We also examined whether differences exist between HIV-1 genetic variants.         Design:\~A total of 3736 sequences from individuals failing standard first-line ART (n = 1599, zidovudine/stavudine + lamivudine + neviparine/efavirenz) were analyzed and compared with sequences from reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI)-naive individuals (n = 2137) from 10 West and Central African countries.         Methods:\~Fisher exact tests and corrections for multiple comparisons were used to assess the significance of associations.         Results:\~All RTI-DRM from the 2015 International Antiviral Society list, except F227C, and nine mutations from other expert lists were observed to confer extensive resistance and cross-resistance. Five additional independently selected mutations (I94L, L109I, V111L, T139R and T165L) were statistically associated with treatment. The proportion of sequences with multiple mutations and the frequency of all thymidine analog mutations, M184V, certain NNRTIS, I94L and L109I showed substantial increase with time on ART. Only one nucleoside and two nonnucleoside RTI-DRMs differed by subtype/circulating recombinant form.         Conclusion:\~This study validates the global robustness of the actual DRM repertoire, in particular for circulating recombinant form 02 predominating in West and Central Africa, despite our finding of five additional selected mutations. However, long-term ART without virological monitoring clearly leads to the accumulation of mutations and the emergence of additional variations, which limit drug options for treatment and can be transmitted. Improved monitoring and optimization of ART are necessary for the long-term effectiveness of ART.},

Nevertheless, a number of questions concerning their properties and inter-relationships remain unresolved. In this paper, we perform an organized study of information theoretic measures for clustering comparison, including several existing popular measures in the literature, as well as some newly proposed ones. We discuss and prove their important properties, such as the metric property and the normalization property. We then highlight to the clustering community the importance of correcting information theoretic measures for chance, especially when the data size is small compared to the number of clusters present therein. Of the available information theoretic based measures, we advocate the normalized information distance (NID) as a general measure of choice, for it possesses concurrently several important properties, such as being both a metric and a normalized measure, admitting an exact analytical adjusted-for-chance form, and using the nominal [0, 1] range better than other normalized variants.},

  abstract   = {Estimating the true number of clusters in a data set is one of the major challenges in cluster analysis. Yet in certain domains,knowing the true number of clusters is of high importance. For example, in medical research, detecting the true number of groups and sub-groups of cancer would be of utmost importance for their effective treatment. In this paper we propose a novel method to estimate the number of clusters in a micro array data set based on the consensus clustering approach. Although the main objective of consensus clustering is to discover a robust and high quality cluster structure in a data set, closer inspection of the set of clusterings obtained can often give valuable information about the appropriate number of clusters present. More specifically, the set off clusterings obtained when the specified number of clusters coincides with the true number of clusters tends to be less diverse.To quantify this diversity we develop a novel index, namely the Consensus Index (CI), which is built upon a suitable clustering similarity measure such as the well known Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)or our recently developed, information theoretic based index, namely the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI). Our experiments on both synthetic and real microarray data sets indicate that the CI is a useful indicator for determining the appropriate number of clusters.},

Although the previous coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics raised awareness of the need for clinically available therapeutic or preventive interventions, to date, no treatments with proven efficacy are available. The development of effective intervention strategies relies on the knowledge of molecular and cellular mechanisms of coronavirus infections, which highlights the significance of studying virus–host interactions at the molecular level to identify targets for antiviral intervention and to elucidate critical viral and host determinants that are decisive for the development of severe disease. In this Review, we summarize the first discoveries that shape our current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout the intracellular viral life cycle and relate that to our knowledge of coronavirus biology. The elucidation of similarities and differences between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses will support future preparedness and strategies to combat coronavirus infections.},

Our method enables both model selection and estimation of epidemiological parameters from very large phylogenies. We demonstrate its speed and accuracy on simulated data, where it performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. To illustrate its applicability, we assess the dynamics induced by superspreading individuals in an HIV dataset of men-having-sex-with-men in Zurich.

Pilon works with many types of sequence data, but is particularly strong when supplied with paired end data from two Illumina libraries with small e.g., 180 bp and large e.g., 3–5 Kb inserts. Pilon significantly improves draft genome assemblies by correcting bases, fixing mis-assemblies and filling gaps. For both haploid and diploid genomes, Pilon produces more contiguous genomes with fewer errors, enabling identification of more biologically relevant genes. Furthermore, Pilon identifies small variants with high accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art tools and is unique in its ability to accurately identify large sequence variants including duplications and resolve large insertions. Pilon is being used to improve the assemblies of thousands of new genomes and to identify variants from thousands of clinically relevant bacterial strains.

@article{wangAccurateNovoPrediction2017,
  abstract     = {Motivation Protein contacts contain key information for the understanding of protein structure and function and thus, contact prediction from sequence is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not very useful for de novo structure prediction. Method This paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual neural networks. The first residual network conducts a series of 1-dimensional convolutional transformation of sequential features; the second residual network conducts a series of 2-dimensional convolutional transformation of pairwise information including output of the first residual network, EC information and pairwise potential. By using very deep residual networks, we can accurately model contact occurrence patterns and complex sequence-structure relationship and thus, obtain higher-quality contact prediction regardless of how many sequence homologs are available for proteins in question. Results Our method greatly outperforms existing methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted folding. Tested on 105 CASP11 targets, 76 past CAMEO hard targets, and 398 membrane proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained by our method, one representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints but without any force fields can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore{$>$}0.6) for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models especially for membrane proteins. The 3D models built from our contact prediction have TMscore{$>$}0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins, while those from homology modeling have TMscore{$>$}0.5 for only 10 of them. Further, even if trained mostly by soluble proteins, our deep learning method works very well on membrane proteins. In the recent blind CAMEO benchmark, our fully-automated web server implementing this method successfully folded 6 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs, including one β protein of 182 residues, one α+β protein of 125 residues, one α protein of 140 residues, one α protein of 217 residues, one α/β of 260 residues and one α protein of 462 residues. Our method also achieved the highest F1 score on free-modeling targets in the latest CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction), although it was not fully implemented back then.

@article{wangComparisonLinearGap2011,
  abstract     = {Profile–profile alignment algorithms have proven powerful for recognizing remote homologs and generating alignments by effectively integrating sequence evolutionary information into scoring functions. In comparison to scoring function, the development of gap penalty functions has rarely been addressed in profile–profile alignment algorithms. Although indel frequency profiles have been used to construct profile-based variable gap penalties in some profile–profile alignment algorithms, there is still no fair comparison between variable gap penalties and traditional linear gap penalties to quantify the improvement of alignment accuracy. We compared two linear gap penalty functions, the traditional affine gap penalty (AGP) and the bilinear gap penalty (BGP), with two profile-based variable gap penalty functions, the Profile-based Gap Penalty used in SP5 (SPGP) and a new Weighted Profile-based Gap Penalty (WPGP) developed by us, on some well-established benchmark datasets. Our results show that profile-based variable gap penalties get limited improvements than linear gap penalties, whether incorporated with secondary structure information or not. Secondary structure information appears less powerful to be incorporated into gap penalties than into scoring functions. Analysis of gap length distributions indicates that gap penalties could stably maintain corresponding distributions of gap lengths in their alignments, but the distribution difference from reference alignments does not reflect the performance of gap penalties. There is useful information in indel frequency profiles, but it is still not good enough for improving alignment accuracy when used in profile-based variable gap penalties.

  abstract     = {With extremely high density and durable preservation, DNA data storage has become one of the most cutting-edge techniques for long-term data storage. Similar to traditional storage which impose restrictions on the form of encoded data, data stored in DNA storage systems are also subject to two biochemical constraints, i.e., maximum homopolymer run limit and balanced GC content limit. Previous studies used successive process to satisfy these two constraints. As a result, the process suffers low efficiency and high complexity. In this letter, we propose a novel content-balanced run-length limited code with an efficient code construction method, which generates short DNA sequences that satisfy both constraints at one time. Besides, we develop an encoding method to map binary data into long DNA sequences for DNA data storage, which ensures both local and global stability in terms of satisfying the biochemical constraints. The proposed encoding method has high effective code rate of 1.917 bits per nucleotide and low coding complexity.},

However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses \$O(n\^2)\$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from \$O(n\^2)\$ to \$O(n)\$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textbackslash textit\{Linformer\}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.},

However, experimental approaches have only determined the methylation state of a small portion of the human genome. We developed deep learning based (stacked denoising autoencoders, or SdAs) software named “DeepMethyl” to predict the methylation state of DNA CpG dinucleotides using features inferred from three-dimensional genome topology (based on Hi-C) and DNA sequence patterns. We used the experimental data from immortalised myelogenous leukemia (K562) and healthy lymphoblastoid (GM12878) cell lines to train the learning models and assess prediction performance. We have tested various SdA architectures with different configurations of hidden layer(s) and amount of pre-training data and compared the performance of deep networks relative to support vector machines (SVMs). Using the methylation states of sequentially neighboring regions as one of the learning features, an SdA achieved a blind test accuracy of 89.7\% for GM12878 and 88.6\% for K562. When the methylation states of sequentially neighboring regions are unknown, the accuracies are 84.82\% for GM12878 and 72.01\% for K562. We also analyzed the contribution of genome topological features inferred from Hi-C. DeepMethyl can be accessed at http://dna.cs.usm.edu/deepmethyl/.},

@article{wangProteinSequenceProtein2017,
  abstract     = {Sequence describes the primary structure of a protein, which contains important structural, characteristic, and genetic information and thereby motivates many sequence-based computational approaches to infer protein function. Among them, feature-base approaches attract increased attention because they make prediction from a set of transformed and more biologically meaningful sequence features. However, original features extracted from sequence are usually of high dimensionality and often compromised by irrelevant patterns, therefore dimension reduction is necessary prior to classification for efficient and effective protein function prediction. A protein usually performs several different functions within an organism, which makes protein function prediction a multi-label classification problem. In machine learning, multi-label classification deals with problems where each object may belong to more than one class. As a well-known feature reduction method, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) has been successfully applied in many practical applications. It, however, by nature is designed for single-label classification, in which each object can belong to exactly one class. Because directly applying LDA in multi-label classification causes ambiguity when computing scatters matrices, we apply a new Multi-label Linear Discriminant Analysis (MLDA) approach to address this problem and meanwhile preserve powerful classification capability inherited from classical LDA. We further extend MLDA by \$\\textbackslash ell \_1\$ -normalization to overcome the problem of over-counting data points with multiple labels. In addition, we incorporate biological network data using Laplacian embedding into our method, and assess the reliability of predicted putative functions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate promising results of our methods.},

Although utilities exist for genome base polishing, they work best with high read coverage and do not scale well. We developed ntEdit, a Bloom filter-based genome sequence editing utility that scales to large mammalian and conifer genomes.We first tested ntEdit and the state-of-the-art assembly improvement tools GATK, Pilon and Racon on controlled Escherichia coli and Caenorhabditis elegans sequence data. Generally, ntEdit performs well at low sequence depths (\&lt;20×), fixing the majority (\&gt;97\%) of base substitutions and indels, and its performance is largely constant with increased coverage. In all experiments conducted using a single CPU, the ntEdit pipeline executed in \&lt;14\\,s and \&lt;3\\,m , on average, on E.coli and C.elegans, respectively. We performed similar benchmarks on a sub-20× coverage human genome sequence dataset, inspecting accuracy and resource usage in editing chromosomes 1 and 21, and whole genome. ntEdit scaled linearly, executing in 30–40\\,m on those sequences. We show how ntEdit ran in \&lt;2 h 20 m to improve upon long and linked read human genome assemblies of NA12878, using high-coverage (54×) Illumina sequence data from the same individual, fixing frame shifts in coding sequences.

  abstract     = {Protein subcellular localization (PSL), as one of the most critical characteristics of human cells, plays an important role for understanding specific functions and biological processes in cells. Accurate prediction of protein subcellular localization is a fundamental and challenging problem, for which machine learning algorithms have been widely used. Traditionally, the performance of PSL prediction highly depends on handcrafted feature descriptors to represent proteins. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a hot research topic in the field of machine learning, achieving outstanding success in learning high-level latent features within data samples. In this paper, to accurately predict protein subcellular locations, we propose a deep learning based predictor called DeepPSL by using Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) networks. In this predictor, we automatically learn high-level and abstract feature representations of proteins by exploring non-linear relations among diverse subcellular locations, addressing the problem of the need of handcrafted feature representations. Experimental results evaluated with three-fold cross validation show that the proposed DeepPSL outperforms traditional machine learning based methods. It is expected that DeepPSL, as the first predictor in the field of PSL prediction, has great potential to be a powerful computational method complementary to existing tools.},

  abstract     = {Background: Given the demonstrated utility of Third Generation Sequencing [Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)] long reads in many studies, a comprehensive analysis and comparison of their data quality and applications is in high demand. Methods: Based on the transcriptome sequencing data from human embryonic stem cells, we analyzed multiple data features of PacBio and ONT, including error pattern, length, mappability and technical improvements over previous platforms. We also evaluated their application to transcriptome analyses, such as isoform identification and quantification and characterization of transcriptome complexity, by comparing the performance of size-selected PacBio, non-size-selected ONT and their corresponding Hybrid-Seq strategies (PacBio+Illumina and ONT+Illumina). Results: PacBio shows overall better data quality, while ONT provides a higher yield. As with data quality, PacBio performs marginally better than ONT in most aspects for both long reads only and Hybrid-Seq strategies in transcriptome analysis. In addition, Hybrid-Seq shows superior performance over long reads only in most transcriptome analyses. Conclusions: Both PacBio and ONT sequencing are suitable for full-length single-molecule transcriptome analysis. As this first use of ONT reads in a Hybrid-Seq analysis has shown, both PacBio and ONT can benefit from a combined Illumina strategy. The tools and analytical methods developed here provide a resource for future applications and evaluations of these rapidly-changing technologies.},

@article{wensingFifteenYearsHIV2010,
  abstract     = {HIV protease plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle and is essential for the generation of mature infectious virus particles. Detailed knowledge of the structure of HIV protease and its substrate has led to the design of specific HIV protease inhibitors. Unfortunately, resistance to all protease inhibitors (PIs) has been observed and the genetic basis of resistance has been well documented over the past 15 years. The arrival of the early PIs was a pivotal moment in the development of antiretroviral therapy. They made possible the dual class triple combination therapy that became known as HAART. However, the clinical utility of the first generation of PIs was limited by low bioavailability and high pill burdens, which ultimately reduced adherence and limited long-term viral inhibition. When therapy failure occurred multiple protease resistance mutations were observed, often resulting in broad class resistance. To combat PI-resistance development, second-generation approaches have been developed. The first advance was to increase the level of existing PIs in the plasma by boosting with ritonavir. The second was to develop novel PIs with high potency against the known PI-resistant HIV protease variants. Both approaches increased the number of protease mutations required for clinical resistance, thereby raising the genetic barrier. This review provides an overview of the history of protease inhibitor therapy, its current status and future perspectives. It forms part of a special issue of Antiviral Research marking the 25th anniversary of antiretroviral drug discovery and development, vol. 85, issue 1, 2010.},

@article{whelanGeneralEmpiricalModel2001,
  abstract     = {Phylogenetic inference from amino acid sequence data uses mainly empirical models of amino acid replacement and is therefore dependent on those models. Two of the more widely used models, the Dayhoff and JTT models, are estimated using similar methods that can utilize large numbers of sequences from many unrelated protein families but are somewhat unsatisfactory because they rely on assumptions that may lead to systematic error and discard a large amount of the information within the sequences. The alternative method of maximum-likelihood estimation may utilize the information in the sequence data more efficiently and suffers from no systematic error, but it has previously been applicable to relatively few sequences related by a single phylogenetic tree. Here, we combine the best attributes of these two methods using an approximate maximum-likelihood method. We implemented this approach to estimate a new model of amino acid replacement from a database of globular protein sequences comprising 3,905 amino acid sequences split into 182 protein families. While the new model has an overall structure similar to those of other commonly used models, there are significant differences. The new model outperforms the Dayhoff and JTT models with respect to maximum-likelihood values for a large majority of the protein families in our database. This suggests that it provides a better overall fit to the evolutionary process in globular proteins and may lead to more accurate phylogenetic tree estimates. Potentially, this matrix, and the methods used to generate it, may also be useful in other areas of research, such as biological sequence database searching, sequence alignment, and protein structure prediction, for which an accurate description of amino acid replacement is required.},

@article{woodfordEmergenceAntibioticResistance2007,
  abstract     = {The emergence of mutations in nucleic acids is one of the major factors underlying evolution, providing the working material for natural selection. Most bacteria are haploid for the vast majority of their genes and, coupled with typically short generation times, this allows mutations to emerge and accumulate rapidly, and to effect significant phenotypic changes in what is perceived to be real-time. Not least among these phenotypic changes are those associated with antibiotic resistance. Mechanisms of horizontal gene spread among bacterial strains or species are often considered to be the main mediators of antibiotic resistance. However, mutational resistance has been invaluable in studies of bacterial genetics, and also has primary clinical importance in certain bacterial species, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori, or when considering resistance to particular antibiotics, especially to synthetic agents such as fluoroquinolones and oxazolidinones. In addition, mutation is essential for the continued evolution of acquired resistance genes and has, e.g., given rise to over 100 variants of the TEM family of β-lactamases. Hypermutator strains of bacteria, which have mutations in genes affecting DNA repair and replication fidelity, have elevated mutation rates. Mutational resistance emerges de novo more readily in these hypermutable strains, and they also provide a suitable host background for the evolution of acquired resistance genes in vitro. In the clinical setting, hypermutator strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, but a more general role for hypermutators in the emergence of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in a wider variety of bacterial pathogens has not yet been proven.},

  abstract     = {A histological specimen from the University of Kinshasa archives has been used to obtain HIV gene sequences dating back to the pre-AIDS era. From a lymph node biopsy taken in 1960 from an adult female in Léopoldville in the Belgian Congo (now Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo), sample 'DRC60' makes possible the first evolutionary analysis of pre-AIDS 'fossil' HIV-1 sequences, via comparison with the one other viral sequence from the period, from a plasma sample taken in 1959, also in Kinshasa. The analysis supports the idea that diversification of HIV-1 in west-central Africa occurred long before the recognized AIDS pandemic. Almost fifty years on, a major concern in HIV epidemiology is China. Here, HIV-1 infection was largely confined to high-risk groups but it is now breaking out into the general population. Lin Lu et al. report on efforts to contain the epidemic in Yunnan Province, where there has been a dramatic increase in sexual transmission of HIV.},

@article{wrablGapsStructurallySimilar2004,
  abstract     = {An algorithm was developed to locally optimize gaps from the FSSP database. Over 2 million gaps were identified from all versus all FSSP structure comparisons, and datasets of non-identical gaps and flanking regions comprising between 90,000 and 135,000 sequence fragments were extracted for statistical analysis. Relative to background frequencies, gaps were enriched in residue types with small side chains and high turn propensity (D, G, N, P, S), and were depleted in residue types with hydrophobic side chains (C, F, I, L, V, W, Y). In contrast, regions flanking a gap exhibited opposite trends in amino acid frequencies, i.e., enrichment in hydrophobic residues and a high degree of secondary structure. Log-odds scores of residue type as a function of position in or around a gap were derived from the statistics. Three simple experiments demonstrated that these scores contained significant predictive information. First, regions where gaps were observed in single sequences taken from HOMSTRAD structure-based multiple sequence alignments generally scored higher than regions where gaps were not observed. Second, given the correct pairwise-aligned cores, the actual positions of gaps could be reproduced from sequence more accurately using the structurally-derived statistics than by using random pairwise alignments. Finally, revision of the Clustal-W residue-specific gap opening parameters with this new information improved the agreement of Clustal-W alignments with the structure-based alignments. At least three applications for these results are envisioned: improvement of gap penalties in pairwise (or multiple) sequence alignment, prediction of regions of single sequences likely (or unlikely) to contain indels, and more accurate placement of gaps in automated pairwise structure alignment.

It is now common to collect or have access to many gigabytes of biological sequences. This has created an urgent need for approaches that analyze sequences in subsets without requiring all of the sequences to be loaded into memory at one time. It has also opened opportunities to improve the organization and accessibility of information acquired in sequencing projects. The DECIPHER package offers solutions to these problems by assisting in the curation of large sets of biological sequences stored in compressed format inside a database. This approach has many practical advantages over standard bioinformatics workflows, and enables large analyses that would otherwise be prohibitively time consuming.},

  abstract      = {Transformer has become ubiquitous in natural language processing (e.g., machine translation, question answering); however, it requires enormous amount of computations to achieve high performance, which makes it not suitable for mobile applications that are tightly constrained by the hardware resources and battery. In this paper, we present an efficient mobile NLP architecture, Lite Transformer to facilitate deploying mobile NLP applications on edge devices. The key primitive is the Long-Short Range Attention (LSRA), where one group of heads specializes in the local context modeling (by convolution) while another group specializes in the long-distance relationship modeling (by attention). Such specialization brings consistent improvement over the vanilla transformer on three well-established language tasks: machine translation, abstractive summarization, and language modeling. Under constrained resources (500M/100M MACs), Lite Transformer outperforms transformer on WMT'14 English-French by 1.2/1.7 BLEU, respectively. Lite Transformer reduces the computation of transformer base model by 2.5x with 0.3 BLEU score degradation. Combining with pruning and quantization, we further compressed the model size of Lite Transformer by 18.2x. For language modeling, Lite Transformer achieves 1.8 lower perplexity than the transformer at around 500M MACs. Notably, Lite Transformer outperforms the AutoML-based Evolved Transformer by 0.5 higher BLEU for the mobile NLP setting without the costly architecture search that requires more than 250 GPU years.

@article{xiongNystromformerNystrombasedAlgorithm2021,
  abstract     = {Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nyströmformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nyström method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nyströmformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nyströmformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nyströmformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/mlpen/Nystromformer.},

Plant virus satellites do not provide any essential function for the helper virus. Plant virus satellites have varied effects on their helper viruses and hosts, including reduction in virus titer and exacerbation or attenuation of symptoms.

The first step of NanoSim is read characterization, which provides a comprehensive alignment-based analysis and generates a set of read profiles serving as the input to the next step, the simulation stage. The simulation stage uses the model built in the previous step to produce in silico reads for a given reference genome. NanoSim is written in Python and R. The source files and manual are available at the Genome Sciences Centre website: http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/nanosim. In this work, we model the base-calling errors of ONT reads to inform the simulation of sequences with similar characteristics. We showcase the performance of NanoSim on publicly available datasets generated using the R7 and R7.3 chemistries and different sequencing kits and compare the resulting synthetic reads to those of other long-sequence simulators and experimental ONT reads. We expect NanoSim to have an enabling role in the field and benefit the development of scalable next-generation sequencing technologies for the long nanopore reads, including genome assembly, mutation detection, and even metagenomic analysis software.},

HAART consists of a double nucleoside (NRTI) backbone plus either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a ritonavir pharmacologically enhanced protease inhibitor (PI/r). Triple NRTI combinations are less potent than 2NRTIs/NNRTI or 2NRTIs/PI/r combinations. Antiretroviral first-line therapy is rapidly moving towards more convenient and less toxic regimens. Three double NRTI co-formulations are now available, and the risk of mitochondrial toxicity is low with drugs such as 3TC, FTC and tenofovir. Similarly, atazanavir, a recently available PI, can be given once daily and is less metabolically toxic than other PIs. Antiretroviral salvage therapy takes advantage of the development or availability of new drugs, either from existing (tipranavir, TMC 114 as new PIs) or new classes (T20 as a fusion inhibitor), that remain active on many triple-class drug resistant viruses. More progress is needed in the field of drug discovery, since a significant proportion of patients still die from AIDS with a multi-resistant virus, and since the incidence of primary HIV resistance is increasing in various parts of the world.},

In addressing the crux of the issue, various attempts to estimate the mutation rate of HIV-1 resulted in a large range of 10−5–10−3 errors/bp/cycle due to the use of different types of investigation methods. In this review, we discuss the different assay methods, their findings on the mutation rates of HIV-1 and how the locations of mutations can be further analyzed for their allosteric effects to allow for new inhibitor designs. Given that HIV is one of the fastest mutating viruses, it serves as a good model for the comprehensive study of viral mutations that can give rise to a more horizontal understanding towards overall viral drug resistance as well as emerging viral diseases.},

Not only crystallographically measured “closed” and “semi-open” structures but also a novel “curled” structure of HIV-1 PR is captured by both kinds of simulations qualitatively and quantitatively. The observation of the “curled” intermediate state helps to connect all other functionally important states to provide an integrated view of the transition pathway of the flap opening of HIV-1 PR (closed → curled → semi-open → fully open). The key residue–residue interactions which are broken or formed in the transition are analyzed to reveal the inherent driving force for the protein conformational transition.},

@inproceedings{zamaniAminoAcidEncoding2011,
  abstract   = {In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of a number of commonly used amino acid encodings by using artificial neural networks and substitution scoring matrices. An important step in many machine learning techniques applied in computational biology is encoding the symbolic data of protein sequences reasonably efficient in numeric vector representations. This encoding can be achieved by either considering the amino acid physicochemical properties or a generic numerical encoding. In order to be effective in the context of a machine learning system, an encoding must preserve information relative to the problem at hand, while diminishing superfluous data. To this end, it is important to measure how much an encoding scheme can conserve the underlying similarities and differences that exist among the amino acids. One way to evaluate the effectiveness of an amino acid encoding scheme is to compare it to the roles that amino acids are actually found to play in biological systems. A numerical representation of the similarities and differences between amino acids can be found in substitution matrices commonly used for sequence alignment, since these substitution matrices are based on measures of the interchangeability of amino acids in biological specimens. In this study, a new encoding scheme is also proposed based on the genetic codon coding occurs during protein synthesis. The experimental results indicate better performances compared to the other commonly used encodings.},

@article{zazziPredictingResponseAntiretroviral2012,
  abstract     = {For a long time, the clinical management of antiretroviral drug resistance was based on sequence analysis of the HIV genome followed by estimating drug susceptibility from the mutational pattern that was detected. The large number of anti-HIV drugs and HIV drug resistance mutations has prompted the development of computer-aided genotype interpretation systems, typically comprising rules handcrafted by experts via careful examination of in vitro and in vivo resistance data. More recently, machine learning approaches have been applied to establish data-driven engines able to indicate the most effective treatments for any patient and virus combination. Systems of this kind, currently including the Resistance Response Database Initiative and the EuResist engine, must learn from the large data sets of patient histories and can provide an objective and accurate estimate of the virological response to different antiretroviral regimens. The EuResist engine was developed by a European consortium of HIV and bioinformatics experts and compares favorably with the most commonly used genotype interpretation systems and HIV drug resistance experts. Next-generation treatment response prediction engines may valuably assist the HIV specialist in the challenging task of establishing effective regimens for patients harboring drug-resistant virus strains. The extensive collection and accurate processing of increasingly large patient data sets are eagerly awaited to further train and translate these systems from prototype engines into real-life treatment decision support tools.},

  abstract   = {Pairwise sequence alignment is one of the most computationally intensive kernels in genomic data analysis, accounting for more than 90\% of the runtime for key bioinformatics applications. This method is particularly expensive for third-generation sequences due to the high computational cost of analyzing sequences of length between 1Kb and 1Mb. Given the quadratic overhead of exact pairwise algorithms for long alignments, the community primarily relies on approximate algorithms that search only for high-quality alignments and stop early when one is not found. In this work, we present the first GPU optimization of the popular X-drop alignment algorithm, that we named LOGAN. Results show that our high-performance multi-GPU implementation achieves up to 181.6 GCUPS and speed-ups up to 6.6× and 30.7× using 1 and 6 NVIDIA Tesla V100, respectively, over the state-of-the-art software running on two IBM Power9 processors using 168 CPU threads, with equivalent accuracy. We also demonstrate a 2.3× LOGAN speed-up versus ksw2, a state-of-art vectorized algorithm for sequence alignment implemented in minimap2, a long-read mapping software. To highlight the impact of our work on a real-world application, we couple LOGAN with a many-to-many long-read alignment software called BELLA, and demonstrate that our implementation improves the overall BELLA runtime by up to 10.6×. Finally, we adapt the Roofline model for LOGAN and demonstrate that our implementation is near optimal on the NVIDIA Tesla V100s.},

Design and Methods:\~         To assess the precision of the Antivirogram and PhenoSense assays, we examined susceptibility results of HIV-1 isolates lacking drug resistance mutations and containing matching patterns of drug resistance mutations. To assess sensitivity, we determined for each assay the proportion of isolates with common patterns of matching drug resistance mutations having reductions in susceptibility greater than those in isolates without drug resistance mutations.         Results:\~         We analyzed protease inhibitor (PI) susceptibility results obtained by the Antivirogram assay for 293 isolates and by the PhenoSense assay for 300 isolates. We analyzed reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor susceptibility results obtained by the Antivirogram assay for 202 isolates and by the PhenoSense assay for 126 isolates. For wild-type and mutant isolates, the median absolute deviance of the fold resistance of nucleoside RT inhibitor susceptibility results was significantly lower for the PhenoSense assay than for the Antivirogram assay. The PhenoSense assay was also significantly more likely than the Antivirogram assay to detect resistance to abacavir, didanosine, and stavudine in isolates with the common drug resistance mutations M41L, M184V, and T215Y (±L210W). We found no significant differences between the 2 assays for detecting PI and nonnucleoside RT inhibitor resistance.         Conclusion:\~         The PhenoSense assay is more precise than the Antivirogram assay and superior at detecting resistance to abacavir, didanosine, and stavudine.},

Its competitive performance in classification is surprising, because the conditional independence assumption on which it is based, is rarely true in realworld applications. An open question is: what is the true reason for the surprisingly good performance of naive Bayes in classification? In this paper, we propose a novel explanation on the superb classification performance of naive Bayes. We show that, essentially, the dependence distribution; i.e., how the local dependence of a node distributes in each class, evenly or unevenly, and how the local dependencies of all nodes work together, consistently (supporting a certain classification) or inconsistently (canceling each other out), plays a crucial role. Therefore, no matter how strong the dependences among attributes are, naive Bayes can still be optimal if the dependences distribute evenly in classes, or if the dependences cancel each other out. We propose and prove a sufficient and necessary conditions for the optimality of naive Bayes. Further, we investigate the optimality of naive Bayes under the Gaussian distribution. We present and prove a sufficient condition for the optimality of naive Bayes, in which the dependence between attributes do exist. This provides evidence that dependence among attributes may cancel out each other. In addition, we explore when naive Bayes works well.},

We have developed a series of single (non-consensus) methods (SPARKS, SP2, SP3, SP4) that are based on weighted matching of two to four sequence and structure-based profiles. There is a robust improvement of the accuracy and sensitivity of fold recognition as the number of matching profiles increases. Here, we introduce a new profile-profile comparison term based on real-value dihedral torsion angles. Together with updated real-value solvent accessibility profile and a new variable gap-penalty model based on fractional power of insertion/deletion profiles, the new method (SP5) leads to a robust improvement over previous SP method. There is a 2\% absolute increase (5\% relative improvement) in alignment accuracy over SP4 based on two independent benchmarks. Moreover, SP5 makes 7\% absolute increase (22\% relative improvement) in success rate of recognizing correct structural folds, and 32\% relative improvement in model accuracy of models within the same fold in Lindahl benchmark. In addition, modeling accuracy of top-1 ranked models is improved by 12\% over SP4 for the difficult targets in CASP 7 test set. These results highlight the importance of harnessing predicted structural properties in challenging remote-homolog recognition. The SP5 server is available at http://sparks.informatics.iupui.edu.},

  abstract     = {Graphene nanopores hold great potential for applications such as molecular detection and DNA sequencing. Here, the authors present a fast and controllable way to fabricate sub-5-nm nanopores on a graphene membrane, with a process including two steps: (i) sputtering a large nanopore using a conventional, focused ion beam; and (ii) shrinking the large nanopore to under 5\\,nm using a scanning electron microscope. Conductance measurements confirm that the electron-beam-induced deposition of hydrocarbons not only shrinks the diameter of the nanopore but also increases its length. Furthermore, the authors report that using a salt gradient across the nanopore allows the detection of 3 nucleotide “C” and 3 nucleotide “G” homopolymer DNA strands based on differences in their physical dimensions.},

@article{zolopaEvolutionHIVTreatment2010,
  abstract     = {Expert panels have provided guidelines for the treatment of HIV infection for more than a decade. The guidelines have evolved rapidly reflecting the remarkable improvements in HIV therapeutics over this time. From guidelines based mostly on expert opinion – the current guidelines are now primarily evidence-based recommendations – which the vast majority of treating clinicians accept and follow. We will highlight the major guideline recommendations for initiation of antiretroviral therapy – focusing on new data for the asymptomatic patient and those presenting with acute AIDS-related opportunistic infections. Given the number of new drugs available, we are currently able to offer virtually all patients in practice – a fully suppressive regimen, even in patients with substantial multi-drug resistant HIV. A remarkable achievement since AZT was first introduced for the treatment of HIV. This article forms part of a special issue of Antiviral Research marking the 25th anniversary of antiretroviral drug discovery and development, vol. 85, issue 1, 2010.},

@article{zoritaStarcodeSequenceClustering2015,
  abstract     = {Motivation: The increasing throughput of sequencing technologies offers new applications and challenges for computational biology. In many of those applications, sequencing errors need to be corrected. This is particularly important when sequencing reads from an unknown reference such as random DNA barcodes. In this case, error correction can be done by performing a pairwise comparison of all the barcodes, which is a computationally complex problem.Results: Here, we address this challenge and describe an exact algorithm to determine which pairs of sequences lie within a given Levenshtein distance. For error correction or redundancy reduction purposes, matched pairs are then merged into clusters of similar sequences. The efficiency of starcode is attributable to the poucet search, a novel implementation of the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm performed on the nodes of a trie. On the task of matching random barcodes, starcode outperforms sequence clustering algorithms in both speed and precision.Availability and implementation: The C source code is available at http://github.com/gui11aume/starcode.Contact:guillaume.filion@gmail.com},

@article{zvelebilPredictionProteinSecondary1987,
  abstract     = {The prediction of protein secondary structure (α-helices, β-sheets and coil) is improved by 9\% to 66\% using the information available from a family of homologous sequences. The approach is based both on averaging the Garnier et al. (1978) secondary structure propensities for aligned residues and on the observation that insertions and high sequence variability tend to occur in loop regions between secondary structures. Accordingly, an algorithm first aligns a family of sequences and a value for the extent of sequence conservation at each position is obtained. This value modifies a Gamier et al. prediction on the averaged sequence to yield the improved prediction. In addition, from the sequence conservation and the predicted secondary structure, many active site regions of enzymes can be located (26 out of 43) with limited over-prediction (8 extra). The entire algorithm is fully automatic and is applicable to all structural classes of globular proteins.},
