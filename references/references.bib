  abstract  = {A novel algorithm for classifier-independent feature selection is proposed. There are two possible ways to select features that are effective for any kind of classifier. One way is to correctly estimate the class-conditional probability densities and the other way is to accurately estimate the discrimination boundary. The purpose of this study is to find the discrimination boundary and to determine the effectiveness of features in terms of normal vectors along the boundary. The fundamental effectiveness of this approach was confirmed by the results of several experiments.},

  abstract     = {Purpose of review~         The HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa is far from being under control and the ambitious UNAIDS targets are unlikely to be met by 2020 as declines in per-capita incidence being largely offset by demographic trends. There is an increasing number of proven and specific HIV prevention tools, but little consensus on how best to deploy them.         Recent findings~         Traditionally, phylogenetics has been used in HIV research to reconstruct the history of the epidemic and date zoonotic infections, whereas more recent publications focus on HIV diversity and drug resistance. However, it is also the most powerful method of source attribution available for the study of HIV transmission. The PANGEA (Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized Epidemics in Africa) consortium has generated over 18 000 NGS HIV sequences from five countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Using phylogenetic methods, we will identify characteristics of individuals or groups, which are most likely to be at risk of infection or at risk of infecting others.         Summary~         Combining phylogenetics, phylodynamics and epidemiology will allow PANGEA to highlight where prevention efforts should be focussed to reduce the HIV epidemic most effectively. To maximise the public health benefit of the data, PANGEA offers accreditation to external researchers, allowing them to access the data and join the consortium. We also welcome submissions of other HIV sequences from sub-Saharan Africa to the database.},

  abstract  = {In large scale applications as computational genome analysis, the space requirement of the suffix tree is a severe drawback. In this paper, we present a uniform framework that enables us to systematically replace every string processing algorithm that is based on a bottomup traversal of a suffix tree by a corresponding algorithm based on an enhanced suffix array (a suffix array enhanced with the lcp-table). In this framework, we will show how maximal, supermaximal, and tandem repeats, as well as maximal unique matches can be efficiently computed. Because enhanced suffix arrays require much less space than suffix trees, very large genomes can now be indexed and analyzed, a task which was not feasible before. Experimental results demonstrate that our programs require not only less space but also much less time than other programs developed for the same tasks.},

  abstract     = {We report the first study to examine phylogenetic relationships and drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 pol sequences from Panama. For this study, we used plasma RNA samples from 135 HIV-1-infected subjects from Panama, of which 82 (61\%) had AIDS and 53 (39\%) were asymptomatic drug-naïve individuals. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that 133 (98\%) subjects were infected with subtype B viruses and 2 AIDS patients harboured recombinant viruses, CRF02\_AG/A3 and CRF12\_BF/B, respectively. Using a Bayesian phylogeny inference method, 5 strongly supported clusters of ≥5 sequences, designated B-PA1 to B-PA5, were identified within subtype B, together comprising 87 (65.4\%) subtype B viruses. Cluster B-PA1 (n=42) was significantly associated with East Panama and clusters B-PA2 (n=15) and B-PA4 (n=10) were associated with West Panama. A Bayesian coalescent analysis indicated that the most recent common ancestors of the four largest clusters were dated in the 1980s and that of the fifth in the early 1990s. The analysis of antiretroviral drug resistance-associated mutations revealed that 8 (9.7\%) AIDS patients, all of them antiretroviral drug-experienced, harboured mutations conferring high or intermediate resistance levels to antiretroviral drugs. No drug resistance mutations were detected among the asymptomatic drug-naïve individuals. In conclusion, the phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 pol sequences from Panama reveals that a majority of subtype B viruses, which are predominant in Panama, branch within well supported intrasubtype phylogenetic clusters, most of them originating in the 1980s, and some with geographical associations, which may reflect either multiple HIV-1 subtype B introductions or the existence of local transmission networks originating in the early epidemic in Panama.},

  abstract     = {Objectives:Review of the available data on the currently available single-tablet regimens (STRs), from the analysis of efficacy and safety to the key points of value in terms of adherence, quality of life and pharmacoeconomic evaluation.Methods:For this narrative review, literature searches have been performed in PubMed, IndexRevMed and Cochrane, using the search terms HIV, single-tablet, one-pill, single dose, fixed-dose, and STR. These have been reviewed and complemented with the most recent publications of interest.Results:Fixed-dose combinations are a significant advance in antiretroviral treatment simplification, contributing to an increase in compliance with complex chronic therapies, thus improving patients’ quality of life. Reducing the number of pills and daily doses is associated with higher adherence and better quality of life. As a fixed-dose combination tablet given once daily, EFV/FTC/TDF was the first available STR combining efficacy, tolerability and convenience, with the simplest dosing schedule and smallest numbers of pills of any ART combination therapy. The RPV/FTC/TDF is a next-generation NNRTI-based STR, a once daily complete ART regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Recently the combination of EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF was also approved by the European Commission, and is the first integrase inhibitor-based STR. Receiving antiretroviral therapy as once daily STR is associated with both clinical and economic benefits, which confirms previous research.Conclusions:The associated benefits of STRs provide a valid strategy for the treatment of HIV-infected patients.},

  abstract     = {HIV virulence, i.e. the time of progression to AIDS, varies greatly among patients. As for other rapidly evolving pathogens of humans, it is difficult to know if this variance is controlled by the genotype of the host or that of the virus because the transmission chain is usually unknown. We apply the phylogenetic comparative approach (PCA) to estimate the heritability of a trait from one infection to the next, which indicates the control of the virus genotype over this trait. The idea is to use viral RNA sequences obtained from patients infected by HIV-1 subtype B to build a phylogeny, which approximately reflects the transmission chain. Heritability is measured statistically as the propensity for patients close in the phylogeny to exhibit similar infection trait values. The approach reveals that up to half of the variance in set-point viral load, a trait associated with virulence, can be heritable. Our estimate is significant and robust to noise in the phylogeny. We also check for the consistency of our approach by showing that a trait related to drug resistance is almost entirely heritable. Finally, we show the importance of taking into account the transmission chain when estimating correlations between infection traits. The fact that HIV virulence is, at least partially, heritable from one infection to the next has clinical and epidemiological implications. The difference between earlier studies and ours comes from the quality of our dataset and from the power of the PCA, which can be applied to large datasets and accounts for within-host evolution. The PCA opens new perspectives for approaches linking clinical data and evolutionary biology because it can be extended to study other traits or other infectious diseases.},

In addition, PCR-based techniques can be used to genotype SVs.Computational methods use genome sequencing data to discover and genotype SVs. There are four main computational approaches: read-pair, read-depth, split-read and sequence-assembly methods.All existing platforms and methods have different biases and limitations.

We show that the simplest models built on top of this unified representation (UniRep) are broadly applicable and generalize to unseen regions of sequence space. Our data-driven approach predicts the stability of natural and de novo designed proteins, and the quantitative function of molecularly diverse mutants, competitively with the state-of-the-art methods. UniRep further enables two orders of magnitude efficiency improvement in a protein engineering task. UniRep is a versatile summary of fundamental protein features that can be applied across protein engineering informatics. UniRep learns fundamental protein features from millions of amino-acid sequences using a recurrent neural network. This summary of features can then be used for protein engineering.},

  abstract     = {Motivation: Chaos Game Representation (CGR) is an iterative mapping technique that processes sequences of units, such as nucleotides in a DNA sequence or amino acids in a protein, in order to find the coordinates for their position in a continuous space. This distribution of positions has two properties: it is unique, and the source sequence can be recovered from the coordinates such that distance between positions measures similarity between the corresponding sequences. The possibility of using the latter property to identify succession schemes have been entirely overlooked in previous studies which raises the possibility that CGR may be upgraded from a mere representation technique to a sequence modeling tool.Results: The distribution of positions in the CGR plane were shown to be a generalization of Markov chain probability tables that accommodates non-integer orders. Therefore, Markov models are particular cases of CGR models rather than the reverse, as currently accepted. In addition, the CGR generalization has both practical (computational efficiency) and fundamental (scale independence) advantages. These results are illustrated by using Escherichia coli K-12 as a test data-set, in particular, the genes thrA , thrB and thrC of the threonine operon.Availability: A web page interface has been created where analyses of arbitrary sequences by CGR can be performed on-line (http://www.itqb.unl.pt:1111/biomat/resources/resources.htm).

While progress has historically ebbed and flowed, the past two years saw dramatic advances driven by the increasing “neuralization” of structure prediction pipelines, whereby computations previously based on energy models and sampling procedures are replaced by neural networks. The extraction of physical contacts from the evolutionary record; the distillation of sequence–structure patterns from known structures; the incorporation of templates from homologs in the Protein Databank; and the refinement of coarsely predicted structures into finely resolved ones have all been reformulated using neural networks. Cumulatively, this transformation has resulted in algorithms that can now predict single protein domains with a median accuracy of 2.1~Å, setting the stage for a foundational reconfiguration of the role of biomolecular modeling within the life sciences.},

Using a random protein model, the relevant statistical parameters are calculated for a variety of substitution matrices and gap costs. An analysis of these parameters elucidates the relative effectiveness of affine as opposed to length-proportional gap costs. Thus, sum statistics provide a method for evaluating sequence similarity that treats short and long gaps differently. By example, the chapter shows how this method has the potential to increase search sensitivity. The statistics described can be applied to the results of fast alignment (FASTA) searches or to those from a variation of the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) programs.},

  abstract     = {Protein sequence alignments have become an important tool for molecular biologists. Local alignments are frequently constructed with the aid of a “substitution score matrix” that specifies a score for aligning each pair of amino acid residues. Over the years, many different substitution matrices have been proposed, based on a wide variety of rationales. Statistical results, however, demonstrate that any such matrix is implicitly a “log-odds” matrix, with a specific target distribution for aligned pairs of amino acid residues. In the light of information theory, it is possible to express the scores of a substitution matrix in bits and to see that different matrices are better adapted to different purposes. The most widely used matrix for protein sequence comparison has been the PAM-250 matrix. It is argued that for database searches the PAM-120 matrix generally is more appropriate, while for comparing two specific proteins with suspected homology the PAM-200 matrix is indicated. Examples discussed include the lipocalins, human α1B-glycoprotein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and the globins.},

Because a single mutation may insert or delete several nucleotides, gap costs that are not directly proportional to gap length are usually the most effective. How to extend such gap costs to alignments of three or more sequences is not immediately obvious, and a variety of approaches have been taken. This paper argues that, since gap and substitution costs together specify optimal alignments, they should be defined using a common rationale. Specifically, a new definition of gap costs for multiple alignments is proposed and compared with previous ones. Since the new definition links a multiple alignment's cost to that of its pairwise projections, it allows knowledge gained about two-sequence alignments to bear on the multiple alignment problem. Also, such linkage is a key element of recent algorithms that have rendered practical the simultaneous alignment of as many as six sequences.},

From structural or multiple alignments of distantly related proteins, it has been observed that conserved residues frequently fall into ungapped blocks separated by relatively nonconserved regions. To take advantage of this structure, a simple generalization of affine gap costs is proposed that allows nonconserved regions to be effectively ignored. The distribution of scores from local alignments using these generalized gap costs is shown empirically to follow an extreme value distribution. Examples are presented for which generalized affine gap costs yield superior alignments from the standpoints both of statistical significance and of alignment accuracy. Guidelines for selecting generalized affine gap costs are discussed, as is their possible application to multiple alignment. Proteins 32:88–96, 1998. Published 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

This paper provides an example for which this part of Gotoh's algorithm fails and describes an algorithm that finds all and only the optimal alignments.

  abstract   = {A substitution matrix is a collection of scores for aligning nucleotides or amino acids with one another. These scores generally represent the relative ease with which one nucleotide or amino acid may mutate into or substitute for another, and they are used to measure similarity in sequence alignments. Substitution matrices are used in conjunction with gap costs to construct local or global alignments. A local alignment substitution matrix implicitly corresponds to a set of target frequencies for aligned letters, which characterise the alignments the matrix may most easily distinguish from chance. Thus different substitution matrices are optimal for comparing related sequences that have diverged to differing degrees. The point accepted mutation and blocks substitution matrix (BLOSUM) series of matrices for protein sequence comparison have been derived from collections of related sequences. Special-purpose matrices may be appropriate for comparing sequences with biased nucleotide or amino acid composition. Key Concepts: Match/mismatch scores generally are suboptimal for comparing protein sequences. A log-odds substitution matrix is characterised by its target frequencies and scale. All local-alignment substitution matrices are implicitly log-odds matrices. Different substitution matrices are tailored to different degrees of evolutionary divergence. Amino acid substitution matrices are constructed from curated sets of alignments. The sequence divergence for which a substitution matrix is tailored may be measured by relative entropy. Special matrices may be preferred for comparing sequences with nonstandard nucleotide or amino acid composition. For gapped local alignments, statistical parameters must be estimated by random simulation. For protein-coding DNA, distant relationships are more easily detected at the protein than at the DNA level. For global alignments, an equivalent scoring system results from adding 2x to all substitution scores, and x to the score for each letter aligned with a null.},

Conventional methods have relied on hand-constructed dictionaries which are tedious to construct and difficult to make tolerant to variation in writing styles. The advantages of machine learning are that it can generalize over the large degree of variation between writing styles and recognition rules can be constructed by example.The system was tested on a sample of handwritten characters from several individuals whose writing ranged from acceptable to poor in quality and the correct average recognition rate obtained using cross-validation was 87.23\%.},

  abstract     = {A prime challenge in precision cancer medicine is to identify genomic and molecular features that are predictive of drug treatment responses in cancer cells. Although there are several computational models for accurate drug response prediction, these often lack the ability to infer which feature combinations are the most predictive, particularly for high-dimensional molecular datasets. As increasing amounts of diverse genome-wide data sources are becoming available, there is a need to build new computational models that can effectively combine these data sources and identify maximally predictive feature combinations.We present a novel approach that leverages on systematic integration of data sources to identify response predictive features of multiple drugs. To solve the modeling task we implement a Bayesian linear regression method. To further improve the usefulness of the proposed model, we exploit the known human cancer kinome for identifying biologically relevant feature combinations. In case studies with a synthetic dataset and two publicly available cancer cell line datasets, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of our method compared to the widely used approaches in drug response analysis. As key examples, our model identifies meaningful combinations of features for the well known EGFR, ALK, PLK and PDGFR inhibitors.The source code of the method is available at https://github.com/suleimank/mvlr.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract     = {The rapid replication rate of HIV-1 RNA and its inherent genetic variation have led to the production of many HIV-1 variants with decreased drug susceptibility. The capacity of HIV to develop drug resistance mutations is a major obstacle to long-term effective anti-HIV therapy. Incomplete suppression of viral replication with an initial drug regimen diminishes the clinical benefit to the patient and may promote the development of broader drug resistance that may cause subsequent treatment regimens to be ineffective. The increased clinical use of combination antiretroviral treatment for HIV-1 infection has led to the selection of viral strains resistant to multiple drugs, including strains resistant to all licensed nucleoside analog RT inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Therefore, it is important to understand the influence of such mutations on viral properties such as replicative fitness, fidelity, and mutation rates. Although research continues to improve our understanding of resistance, leading to refined treatment strategies and, in some cases, improved outcome, resistance to antiretroviral therapy remains a major cause of treatment failure among patients living with HIV-1.},

@article{arayaSupportVectorMachine2009,
  abstract     = {The drug resistance of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is due to its fast and error-prone replication, is a key factor in the failure to combat the HIV epidemic. Performing pre-therapy drug resistance testing and administering appropriate drugs, or a combination of drugs, is therefore very useful. Genotyping tests HIV drug resistance by detecting specific mutations known to confer drug resistance. It is also cheaper than phenotypic testing and can be computerised, but it requires being able to know which mutations confer drug resistance. Previous research using pattern recognition techniques has been promising, but needs to be improved. It is also important that the techniques be highly adaptive when faced with new mutations or drugs. A relatively recent addition to pattern recognition techniques is the Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVMs have proved very successful in many benchmark applications such as face recognition and text recognition, and have also performed well in many computational biology problems. This paper explores the use of SVMs in predicting the drug resistance of an HIV strain extracted from a patient based on the genetic sequence of the viral DNA. We use as a case study that part of the HIV DNA that codes for the two enzymes, reverse transcriptase and protease, which are critical for the replication of the virus. To evaluate the performance of SVMs we used cross-validation to measure the unbiased estimate on 2045 data sets. The accuracy of classification and the area under the receiver operation characteristics (ROC) curve was used as a performance measure. We also developed other prediction models based on popular classification algorithms, namely neural networks, decision trees and logistic regression and these are explored in the paper. The results show that SVMs are a highly successful classifier and perform better than the other techniques with performance ranging between 94.1\% and 96.3\% accuracy and 81.3\% and 97.5\% area under the ROC curve.},

  abstract     = {Background The HIV-1 epidemic in Ethiopia has been shown to be dominated by two phylogenetically distinct subtype C clades, the Ethiopian (C’-ET) and East African (C-EA) clades, however, little is known about the temporal dynamics of the HIV epidemic with respect to subtypes and distinct clades. Moreover, there is only limited information concerning transmission of HIV-1 drug resistance (TDR) in the country. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among young antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve individuals recently diagnosed with HIV infection, in Gondar, Ethiopia, 2011–2013 using the WHO recommended threshold survey. A total of 84 study participants with a median age of 22 years were enrolled. HIV-1 genotyping was performed and investigated for drug resistance in 67 individuals. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on all available HIV sequences obtained from Gondar (n = 301) which were used to define subtype C clades, temporal trends and local transmission clusters. Dating of transmission clusters was performed using BEAST. Result Four of 67 individuals (6.0\%) carried a HIV drug resistance mutation strain, all associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Strains of the C-EA clade were most prevalent as we found no evidence of temporal changes during this time period. However, strains of the C-SA clade, prevalent in Southern Africa, have been introduced in Ethiopia, and became more abundant during the study period. The oldest Gondar transmission clusters dated back to 1980 (C-EA), 1983 (C-SA) and 1990 (C’-ET) indicating the presence of strains of different subtype C clades at about the same time point in Gondar. Moreover, some of the larger clusters dated back to the 1980s but transmissions within clusters have been ongoing up till end of the study period. Besides being associated with more sequences and larger clusters, the C-EA clade sequences were also associated with clustering of HIVDR sequences. One cluster was associated with the G190A mutation and showed onward transmissions at high rate. Conclusion TDR was detected in 6.0\% of the sequenced samples and confirmed pervious reports that the two subtype C clades, C-EA and C’-ET, are common in Ethiopia. Moreover, the findings indicated an increased diversity in the epidemic as well as differences in transmission clusters sizes of the different clades and association with resistance mutations. These findings provide epidemiological insights not directly available using standard surveillance and may inform the adjustment of public health strategies in HIV prevention in Ethiopia.},

  abstract     = {Rapidly improving sequencing technology coupled with computational developments in sequence assembly are making reference-quality genome assembly economical. Hundreds of vertebrate genome assemblies are now publicly available, and projects are being proposed to sequence thousands of additional species in the next few years. Such dense sampling of the tree of life should give an unprecedented new understanding of evolution and allow a detailed determination of the events that led to the wealth of biodiversity around us. To gain this knowledge, these new genomes must be compared through genome alignment (at the sequence level) and comparative annotation (at the gene level). However, different alignment and annotation methods have different characteristics; before starting a comparative genomics analysis, it is important to understand the nature of, and biases and limitations inherent in, the chosen methods. This review is intended to act as a technical but high-level overview of the field that should provide this understanding. We briefly survey the state of the genome alignment and comparative annotation fields and potential future directions for these fields in a new, large-scale era of comparative genomics.},

  abstract   = {Statistical inference from the analysis of biological sequences is widely used in the prediction of structure and biochemical functions of newly found macromolecules. For the application of machine learning methodologies such as kernel methods and artificial neural networks for such inference, variable length sequence data is often embedded in a finite dimensional real-valued space. The corresponding embedding dimensions are often high, leading to technical difficulties centred around the statistical concept of the curse of dimensionality. We demonstrate a trade-off between fidelity of representation of amino acids of proteins and the resulting dimensionality of the embedding space. Clustering chemically similar amino acids, thereby reducing the alphabet size, reduces the accuracy in their variation, but achieves a reduction in the corresponding feature space. We show this trade-off in three different problems of statistical inference, namely, protein-protein interaction, remote homology and secondary structure prediction. We show that in the reduced space performance often improves similar to what is seen in "diminishing returns" type reward-effort curves. We find alphabet reduction schemes taken from the literature, which are based on some biochemical rationale, perform significantly better than arbitrary random clustering of the alphabets. Statistical feature selection from the full 20 amino acid representation is not competitive with any of these. Dimensionality of representation has an important role when mapping sequence data onto fixed dimensions of an Euclidean space. This work shows that dimensionality reduction based on compressing the amino acid alphabet improves inference performance in two widely studied problems and degrades gracefully in the third. Alphabet reduction, which has a principled biochemical basis, is shown to be superior to feature selection which is purely a statistical exercise.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new representation and feature extraction method for biological sequences. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. In the present paper, we focus on protein-vectors that can be utilized in a wide array of bioinformatics investigations such as family classification, protein visualization, structure prediction, disordered protein identification, and protein-protein interaction prediction. In this method, we adopt artificial neural network approaches and represent a protein sequence with a single dense n-dimensional vector. To evaluate this method, we apply it in classification of 324,018 protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein families, where an average family classification accuracy of 93\%±0.06\% is obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods. In addition, we use ProtVec representation to predict disordered proteins from structured proteins. Two databases of disordered sequences are used: the DisProt database as well as a database featuring the disordered regions of nucleoporins rich with phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-Nups). Using support vector machine classifiers, FG-Nup sequences are distinguished from structured protein sequences found in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a 99.8\% accuracy, and unstructured DisProt sequences are differentiated from structured DisProt sequences with 100.0\% accuracy. These results indicate that by only providing sequence data for various proteins into this model, accurate information about protein structure can be determined. Importantly, this model needs to be trained only once and can then be applied to extract a comprehensive set of information regarding proteins of interest. Moreover, this representation can be considered as pre-training for various applications of deep learning in bioinformatics.

However, higher raw read error rates are an intrinsic drawback in most TGS technologies. Here we present a computational method, LSC, to perform error correction of TGS long reads (LR) by SGS short reads (SR). Aiming to reduce the error rate in homopolymer runs in the main TGS platform, the PacBio® RS, LSC applies a homopolymer compression (HC) transformation strategy to increase the sensitivity of SR-LR alignment without scarifying alignment accuracy. We applied LSC to 100,000 PacBio long reads from human brain cerebellum RNA-seq data and 64 million single-end 75 bp reads from human brain RNA-seq data. The results show LSC can correct PacBio long reads to reduce the error rate by more than 3 folds. The improved accuracy greatly benefits many downstream analyses, such as directional gene isoform detection in RNA-seq study. Compared with another hybrid correction tool, LSC can achieve over double the sensitivity and similar specificity.},

Study Design and Setting We conducted a study of all 10,674,945 residents of Ontario aged between 18 and 100 years in 2000. Residents were randomly assigned to equally sized derivation and validation cohorts and classified according to their astrological sign. Using the derivation cohort, we searched through 223 of the most common diagnoses for hospitalization until we identified two for which subjects born under one astrological sign had a significantly higher probability of hospitalization compared to subjects born under the remaining signs combined (P{$<$}0.05). Results We tested these 24 associations in the independent validation cohort. Residents born under Leo had a higher probability of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (P=0.0447), while Sagittarians had a higher probability of humerus fracture (P=0.0123) compared to all other signs combined. After adjusting the significance level to account for multiple comparisons, none of the identified associations remained significant in either the derivation or validation cohort. Conclusions Our analyses illustrate how the testing of multiple, non-prespecified hypotheses increases the likelihood of detecting implausible associations. Our findings have important implications for the analysis and interpretation of clinical studies.},

  abstract     = {Higher accessibility and decreasing costs of next generation sequencing (NGS), availability of commercial kits, and development of dedicated analysis pipelines, have allowed an increasing number of laboratories to adopt this technology for HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) genotyping. Conventional HIVDR genotyping is traditionally carried out using population-based Sanger sequencing, which has a limited capacity for reliable detection of variants present at intra-host frequencies below a threshold of approximately 20\%. NGS has the potential to improve sensitivity and quantitatively identify low-abundance variants, improving efficiency and lowering costs. However, some challenges exist for the standardization and quality assurance of NGS-based HIVDR genotyping. In this paper, we highlight considerations of these challenges as related to laboratory, clinical, and implementation of NGS for HIV drug resistance testing. Several sources of variation and bias occur in each step of the general NGS workflow, i.e., starting material, sample type, PCR amplification, library preparation method, instrument and sequencing chemistry-inherent errors, and data analysis options and limitations. Additionally, adoption of NGS-based HIVDR genotyping, especially for clinical care, poses pressing challenges, especially for resource-poor settings, including infrastructure and equipment requirements and cost, logistic and supply chains, instrument service availability, personnel training, validated laboratory protocols, and standardized analysis outputs. The establishment of external quality assessment programs may help to address some of these challenges and is needed to proceed with NGS-based HIVDR genotyping adoption.},

Because of the lack of a vaccine and antiviral drugs, the sole measure of control is limiting the Aedes mosquito vectors. DENV infection can be asymptomatic or a self-limited, acute febrile disease ranging in severity. The classical form of dengue fever (DF) is characterized by high fever, headache, stomach ache, rash, myalgia, and arthralgia. Severe dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are accompanied by thrombocytopenia, vascular leakage, and hypotension. DSS, which can be fatal, is characterized by systemic shock. Despite intensive research, the underlying mechanisms causing severe dengue is still not well understood partly due to the lack of appropriate animal models of infection and disease. However, even though it is clear that both viral and host factors play important roles in the course of infection, a fundamental knowledge gap still remains to be filled regarding host cell tropism, crucial host immune response mechanisms, and viral markers for virulence.},

METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial of oral antiretroviral therapy for use as preexposure prophylaxis among HIV-1-serodiscordant heterosexual couples from Kenya and Uganda. The HIV-1-seronegative partner in each couple was randomly assigned to one of three study regimens--once-daily tenofovir (TDF), combination tenofovir-emtricitabine (TDF-FTC), or matching placebo--and followed monthly for up to 36 months. At enrollment, the HIV-1-seropositive partners were not eligible for antiretroviral therapy, according to national guidelines. All couples received standard HIV-1 treatment and prevention services. RESULTS: We enrolled 4758 couples, of whom 4747 were followed: 1584 randomly assigned to TDF, 1579 to TDF-FTC, and 1584 to placebo. For 62\% of the couples followed, the HIV-1-seronegative partner was male. Among HIV-1-seropositive participants, the median CD4 count was 495 cells per cubic millimeter (interquartile range, 375 to 662). A total of 82 HIV-1 infections occurred in seronegative participants during the study, 17 in the TDF group (incidence, 0.65 per 100 person-years), 13 in the TDF-FTC group (incidence, 0.50 per 100 person-years), and 52 in the placebo group (incidence, 1.99 per 100 person-years), indicating a relative reduction of 67\% in the incidence of HIV-1 with TDF (95\% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 81; P{$<$}0.001) and of 75\% with TDF-FTC (95\% CI, 55 to 87; P{$<$}0.001). Protective effects of TDF-FTC and TDF alone against HIV-1 were not significantly different (P=0.23), and both study medications significantly reduced the HIV-1 incidence among both men and women. The rate of serious adverse events was similar across the study groups. Eight participants receiving active treatment were found to have been infected with HIV-1 at baseline, and among these eight, antiretroviral resistance developed in two during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Oral TDF and TDF-FTC both protect against HIV-1 infection in heterosexual men and women.

  abstract      = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

We introduce DeepConsensus, which uses an alignment-based loss to train a gap-aware transformer–encoder for sequence correction. Compared to pbccs, DeepConsensus reduces read errors by 42\%. This increases the yield of PacBio HiFi reads at Q20 by 9\%, at Q30 by 27\% and at Q40 by 90\%. With two SMRT Cells of HG003, reads from DeepConsensus improve hifiasm assembly contiguity (NG50 4.9\,megabases (Mb) to 17.2\,Mb), increase gene completeness (94\% to 97\%), reduce the false gene duplication rate (1.1\% to 0.5\%), improve assembly base accuracy (Q43 to Q45) and reduce variant-calling errors by 24\%. DeepConsensus models could be trained to the general problem of analyzing the alignment of other types of sequences, such as unique molecular identifiers or genome assemblies.},

@article{balabanTreeClusterClusteringBiological2019,
  abstract     = {Clustering homologous sequences based on their similarity is a problem that appears in many bioinformatics applications. The fact that sequences cluster is ultimately the result of their phylogenetic relationships. Despite this observation and the natural ways in which a tree can define clusters, most applications of sequence clustering do not use a phylogenetic tree and instead operate on pairwise sequence distances. Due to advances in large-scale phylogenetic inference, we argue that tree-based clustering is under-utilized. We define a family of optimization problems that, given an arbitrary tree, return the minimum number of clusters such that all clusters adhere to constraints on their heterogeneity. We study three specific constraints, limiting (1) the diameter of each cluster, (2) the sum of its branch lengths, or (3) chains of pairwise distances. These three problems can be solved in time that increases linearly with the size of the tree, and for two of the three criteria, the algorithms have been known in the theoretical computer scientist literature. We implement these algorithms in a tool called TreeCluster, which we test on three applications: OTU clustering for microbiome data, HIV transmission clustering, and divide-and-conquer multiple sequence alignment. We show that, by using tree-based distances, TreeCluster generates more internally consistent clusters than alternatives and improves the effectiveness of downstream applications.

This virus is a typical type-C RNA tumor virus, buds from the cell membrane, prefers magnesium for reverse transcriptase activity, and has an internal antigen (p25) similar to HTLV p24. Antibodies from serum of this patient react with proteins from viruses of the HTLV-I subgroup, but type-specific antisera to HTLV-I do not precipitate proteins of the new isolate. The virus from this patient has been transmitted into cord blood lymphocytes, and the virus produced by these cells is similar to the original isolate. From these studies it is concluded that this virus as well as the previous HTLV isolates belong to a general family of T-lymphotropic retroviruses that are horizontally transmitted in humans and may be involved in several pathological syndromes, including AIDS.},

Using concatenated amino acid sequences of proteins belonging to a particular family and a 12-sided regular polygon, each vertex of which represents a group of amino acid residues leading to conservative substitutions, the method can generate the CGR of the family and allows pictorial representation of the pattern characterizing the family. An estimation of the percentages of points plotted in different segments of the CGR (grid points) allows quantification of the nonrandomness of the CGR patterns generated. The CGRs of different protein families exhibited distinct visually identifiable patterns. This implies that different functional classes of proteins follow specific statistical biases in the distribution of different mono-, di-, tri-, or higher order peptides along their primary sequences. The potential of grid counts as the discriminative and diagnostic signature of a family of proteins is discussed.},

  abstract     = {Objectives The aim of this analysis was to characterize transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START) study participants by next-generation sequencing (NGS), a sensitive assay capable of detecting low-frequency variants. Methods Stored plasma from participants with entry HIV RNA {$>$} 1000 copies/mL were analysed by NGS (Illumina MiSeq). TDR was based on the WHO 2009 surveillance definition with the addition of reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations T215N and E138K, and integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) surveillance mutations (Stanford HIVdb). Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) detected at three thresholds are reported: {$>$} 2\%, 5\% and 20\% of the viral population. Results Between 2009 and 2013, START enrolled 4684 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve individuals in 35 countries. Baseline NGS data at study entry were available for 2902 participants. Overall prevalence rates of TDR using a detection threshold of 2\%/5\%/20\% were 9.2\%/5.6\%/3.2\% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 9.2\%/6.6\%/4.9\% for non-NRTIs, 11.4\%/5.5\%/2.4\% for protease inhibitors (PIs) and 3.5\%/1.6\%/0.1\% for INSTI DRMs and varied by geographic region. Using the 2\% detection threshold, individual DRMs with the highest prevalence were: PI M46IL (5.5\%), RT K103NS (3.5\%), RT G190ASE (3.1\%), T215ISCDVEN (2.5\%), RT M41L (2.2\%), RT K219QENR (1.7\%) and PI D30N (1.6\%). INSTI DRMs were detected almost exclusively below the 20\% detection threshold, most commonly Y143H (0.4\%), Q148R (0.4\%) and T66I (0.4\%). Conclusions Use of NGS in this study population resulted in the detection of a large proportion of low-level variants which would not have been detected by traditional Sanger sequencing. Global surveillance studies utilizing NGS should provide a more comprehensive assessment of TDR prevalence in different regions of the world.},

HIV is one of the most genetically diverse pathogens due to its high-mutation and recombination rates, large population size and rapid replication rate. This rapid evolutionary process has resulted in several HIV subtypes that are heterogeneously globally distributed.         Recent findings~         Subtype A remains the most prevalent strain in parts of East Africa, Russia and former Soviet Union countries; subtype B in Europe, Americas and Oceania; subtype C in Southern Africa and India; CRF01\_AE in Asia and CRF02\_AG in Western Africa. Recent studies based on near full-length genome sequencing highlighted the growing importance of recombinant variants and subtype C viruses.         Summary~         The dynamic change in HIV subtype distribution presents future challenges for diagnosis, treatment and vaccine design and development. An increase in recombinant viruses suggests that coinfection and superinfection by divergent HIV strains has become more common necessitating continuous surveillance to keep track of the viral diversity. Cheaper near full-length genome sequencing approaches are critical in improving HIV subtype estimations. However, missing subtype data and low sequence sampling levels are still a challenge in some geographical regions.         https://links.lww.com/COHA/A14.},

  abstract     = {Hepadnaviruses, including human hepatitis B virus (HBV), replicate through reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate, the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). Despite this kinship to retroviruses, there are fundamental differences beyond the fact that hepadnavirions contain DNA instead of RNA. Most peculiar is the initiation of reverse transcription: it occurs by protein-priming, is strictly committed to using an RNA hairpin on the pgRNA, ε, as template, and depends on cellular chaperones; moreover, proper replication can apparently occur only in the specialized environment of intact nucleocapsids. This complexity has hampered an in-depth mechanistic understanding. The recent successful reconstitution in the test tube of active replication initiation complexes from purified components, for duck HBV (DHBV), now allows for the analysis of the biochemistry of hepadnaviral replication at the molecular level. Here we review the current state of knowledge at all steps of the hepadnaviral genome replication cycle, with emphasis on new insights that turned up by the use of such cell-free systems. At this time, they can, unfortunately, not be complemented by three-dimensional structural information on the involved components. However, at least for the ε RNA element such information is emerging, raising expectations that combining biophysics with biochemistry and genetics will soon provide a powerful integrated approach for solving the many outstanding questions. The ultimate, though most challenging goal, will be to visualize the hepadnaviral reverse transcriptase in the act of synthesizing DNA, which will also have strong implications for drug development.},

Whereas phenotypic assays directly measure drug resistance, the commonly used genotypic assays provide only indirect evidence of drug resistance, the major challenge being the interpretation of the sequence information. We analyzed the significance of sequence variations in the protease and reverse transcriptase genes for drug resistance and derived models that predict phenotypic resistance from genotypes. For 14 antiretroviral drugs, both genotypic and phenotypic resistance data from 471 clinical isolates were analyzed with a machine learning approach. Information profiles were obtained that quantify the statistical significance of each sequence position for drug resistance. For the different drugs, patterns of varying complexity were observed, including between one and nine sequence positions with substantial information content. Based on these information profiles, decision tree classifiers were generated to identify genotypic patterns characteristic of resistance or susceptibility to the different drugs. We obtained concise and easily interpretable models to predict drug resistance from sequence information. The prediction quality of the models was assessed in leave-one-out experiments in terms of the prediction error. We found prediction errors of 9.6–15.5\% for all drugs except for zalcitabine, didanosine, and stavudine, with prediction errors between 25.4\% and 32.0\%.

  abstract     = {Therapeutic success of anti-HIV therapies is limited by the development of drug resistant viruses. These genetic variants display complex mutational patterns in their pol gene, which codes for protease and reverse transcriptase, the molecular targets of current antiretroviral therapy. Genotypic resistance testing depends on the ability to interpret such sequence data, whereas phenotypic resistance testing directly measures relative in vitro susceptibility to a drug. From a set of 650 matched genotype–phenotype pairs we construct regression models for the prediction of phenotypic drug resistance from genotypes. Since the range of resistance factors varies considerably between different drugs, two scoring functions are derived from different sets of predicted phenotypes. Firstly, we compare predicted values to those of samples derived from 178 treatment-naive patients and report the relative deviance. Secondly, estimation of the probability density of 2000 predicted phenotypes gives rise to an intrinsic definition of a susceptible and a resistant subpopulation. Thus, for a predicted phenotype, we calculate the probability of membership in the resistant subpopulation. Both scores provide standardized measures of resistance that can be calculated from the genotype and are comparable between drugs. The geno2pheno system makes these genotype interpretations available via the Internet (http://www.genafor.org/).},

Motivated by recent advances in natural language processing that have demonstrated substantial gains on diverse tasks by pre-training on large unlabeled data, however, unsupervised pre-training on massive databases of protein sequences has proven to be an effective approach to extracting complex information about proteins. Such models have been shown to learn variant effects in coding regions in a zero-shot manner. In a similar vein, we here introduce GPN (Genomic Pre-trained Network) which can learn variant effects in non-coding DNA using unsupervised pre-training on genomic DNA sequence alone. Our model is also able to learn gene structure and DNA motifs without any supervision. We demonstrate the utility of GPN by showing that it outperforms supervised deep learning models such as DeepSEA trained on vast amounts of functional genomics data in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism for plant biology. Additionally, GPN trained on a single genome outperforms popular conservation scores such as phyloP and PhastCons, which are computed using aligned genomes from multiple species and can be used to predict the pathogenicity of variants that perturb highly conserved positions. We provide code (https://github.com/songlab-cal/gpn) to train GPN for any given species using its DNA sequence alone and learn corresponding zero-shot variant effects genome-wide.},

  abstract     = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract     = {The exhaustive matching of the protein sequence database makes possible a broadly based study of insertions and deletions (indels) during divergent evolution. In this study, the probability of a gap in an alignment of a pair of homologous protein sequences was found to increase with the evolutionary distance measured in PAM units (number of accepted point mutations per 100 amino acid residues). A relationship between the average number of amino acid residues between indels and evolutionary distance suggests that a unit 30 to 40 amino acid residues in length remains, on average, undisrupted by indels during divergent evolution. Further, the probability of a gap was found to be inversely proportional to gap length raised to the 1·7 power. This empirical law fits closely over the entire range of gap lengths examined. Gap length distribution is largely independent of evolutionary distance. These results rule out the widely used linear gap penalty as a satisfactory formula for scoring gaps when constructing alignments. Further, the observed gap length distribution can be explained by a simple model of selective pressures governing the acceptance of indels during divergent evolution. Finally, this model provides theoretical support for using indels as part of "parsing algorithms", important in the de novo prediction of the folded structure of proteins form the sequence data.},

In January 2007, we outlined criteria for developing a list of mutations for drug-resistance surveillance and compiled a list of 80 RT and protease mutations meeting these criteria (surveillance drug resistance mutations; SDRMs). Since January 2007, several new drugs have been approved and several new drug-resistance mutations have been identified. In this paper, we follow the same procedures described previously to develop an updated list of SDRMs that are likely to be useful for ongoing and future studies of transmitted drug resistance. The updated SDRM list has 93 mutations including 34 NRTI-resistance mutations at 15 RT positions, 19 NNRTI-resistance mutations at 10 RT positions, and 40 PI-resistance mutations at 18 protease positions.},

  abstract     = {Summary  Language models have recently emerged as a powerful machine-learning approach for distilling information from massive protein sequence databases. From readily available sequence data alone, these models discover evolutionary, structural, and functional organization across protein space. Using language models, we can encode amino-acid sequences into distributed vector representations that capture their structural and functional properties, as well as evaluate the evolutionary fitness of sequence variants. We discuss recent advances in protein language modeling and their applications to downstream protein property prediction problems. We then consider how these models can be enriched with prior biological knowledge and introduce an approach for encoding protein structural knowledge into the learned representations. The knowledge distilled by these models allows us to improve downstream function prediction through transfer learning. Deep protein language models are revolutionizing protein biology. They suggest new ways to approach protein and therapeutic design. However, further developments are needed to encode strong biological priors into protein language models and to increase their accessibility to the broader community.},

  abstract      = {Inferring the structural properties of a protein from its amino acid sequence is a challenging yet important problem in biology. Structures are not known for the vast majority of protein sequences, but structure is critical for understanding function. Existing approaches for detecting structural similarity between proteins from sequence are unable to recognize and exploit structural patterns when sequences have diverged too far, limiting our ability to transfer knowledge between structurally related proteins. We newly approach this problem through the lens of representation learning. We introduce a framework that maps any protein sequence to a sequence of vector embeddings --- one per amino acid position --- that encode structural information. We train bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) models on protein sequences with a two-part feedback mechanism that incorporates information from (i) global structural similarity between proteins and (ii) pairwise residue contact maps for individual proteins. To enable learning from structural similarity information, we define a novel similarity measure between arbitrary-length sequences of vector embeddings based on a soft symmetric alignment (SSA) between them. Our method is able to learn useful position-specific embeddings despite lacking direct observations of position-level correspondence between sequences. We show empirically that our multi-task framework outperforms other sequence-based methods and even a top-performing structure-based alignment method when predicting structural similarity, our goal. Finally, we demonstrate that our learned embeddings can be transferred to other protein sequence problems, improving the state-of-the-art in transmembrane domain prediction.},

  abstract  = {We describe one application of statistical implication indexes to fuzzy knowledge discovery. After recalling principles of fuzzy logics, we explain how we have adapted statistical indexes to fuzzy knowledge: the support, the confidence and a less common index, the intensity of implication. These indexes highlight statistical links between conjunctions of fuzzy attributes and fuzzy conclusions, but do not evaluate the associated fuzzy rules, which depend of the chosen fuzzy operators. Since fuzzy operators are numerous, we evaluate their sets by applying the generalized modus ponens on the database and by comparing its results to the effective conclusions. We give a summary of the results on several databases, and we present the sets of fuzzy operators that appear to be the best. Studying methods to aggregate fuzzy rules, we show that in order to keep classical reduction schemes, fuzzy operators must be chosen differently. However, one of these possible operator sets is also one of the best for processing the generalized modus ponens.},

  abstract  = {The established approach to unsupervised protein contact prediction estimates co-evolving positions using undirected graphical models. This approach trains a Potts model on a Multiple Sequence Alignment, then predicts that the edges with highest weight correspond to contacts in the 3D structure. On the other hand, increasingly large Transformers are being pretrained on protein sequence databases but have demonstrated mixed results for downstream tasks, including contact prediction. This has sparked discussion about the role of scale and attention-based models in unsupervised protein representation learning. We argue that attention is a principled model of protein interactions, grounded in real properties of protein family data. We introduce a simplified attention layer, factored attention, and show that it achieves comparable performance to Potts models, while sharing parameters both within and across families. Further, we extract contacts from the attention maps of a pretrained Transformer and show they perform competitively with the other two approaches. This provides evidence that large-scale pretraining can learn meaningful protein features when presented with unlabeled and unaligned data. We contrast factored attention with the Transformer to indicate that the Transformer leverages hierarchical signal in protein family databases not captured by our single-layer models. This raises the exciting possibility for the development of powerful structured models of protein family databases.1},

This is a crucial problem in sequence analysis since the frequent pattern mining algorithms are unsupervised and can produce huge amounts of rules. While association rule interestingness has been widely studied in the literature, there are few measures dedicated to sequential rules. Continuing with our work on the adaptation of implication intensity to sequential rules, we propose an original statistical measure for assessing sequential rule interestingness. More precisely, this measure named Sequential Implication Intensity (SII) evaluates the statistical significance of the rules in comparison with a probabilistic model. Numerical simulations show that SII has unique features for a sequential rule interestingness measure.},

Two additional INIs in advanced clinical development—elvitegravir and S/GSK1349572—may prove equally versatile. However, the INIs have a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance in that 1 or 2 mutations are capable of causing marked reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir and elvitegravir, the most well-studied INIs. This perspective reviews the genetic mechanisms of INI resistance and their implications for initial INI therapy, the treatment of antiretroviral-experienced patients, and regimen simplification.},

  abstract     = {Sequencing errors continue to pose algorithmic challenges to methods working with sequencing data. One of the simplest and most prevalent techniques for ameliorating the detrimental effects  of homopolymer expansion/contraction errors present in long read data is homopolymer compression. It collapses runs of repeated nucleotides, with the intuitive goal of removing some of the sequencing errors and often improving mapping sensitivity.  Though our intuitive understanding justifies why homopolymer compression works,  it in no way implies that it is the best transformation that can be done. In this paper, we explore if there are transformations that can be applied in the same pre-processing  manner as homopolymer compression  that would achieve better alignment sensitivity. We introduce a more general framework than homopolymer compression, called mapping-friendly sequence reductions.  We transform the reference and the reads using these reductions and then apply an alignment algorithm.  We demonstrate that some mapping-friendly sequence reductions lead to improved mapping accuracy, outperforming homopolymer compression.},

@article{blasselUsingMachineLearning2021,
  abstract     = {Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) appear in HIV under treatment pressure. DRMs are commonly transmitted to naive patients. The standard approach to reveal new DRMs is to test for significant frequency differences of mutations between treated and naive patients. However, we then consider each mutation individually and cannot hope to study interactions between several mutations. Here, we aim to leverage the ever-growing quantity of high-quality sequence data and machine learning methods to study such interactions (i.e. epistasis), as well as try to find new DRMs. We trained classifiers to discriminate between Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (RTI)-experienced and RTI-naive samples on a large HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) sequence dataset from the UK (n ≈ 55, 000), using all observed mutations as binary representation features. To assess the robustness of our findings, our classifiers were evaluated on independent data sets, both from the UK and Africa. Important representation features for each classifier were then extracted as potential DRMs. To find novel DRMs, we repeated this process by removing either features or samples associated to known DRMs. When keeping all known resistance signal, we detected sufficiently prevalent known DRMs, thus validating the approach. When removing features corresponding to known DRMs, our classifiers retained some prediction accuracy, and six new mutations significantly associated with resistance were identified. These six mutations have a low genetic barrier, are correlated to known DRMs, and are spatially close to either the RT active site or the regulatory binding pocket. When removing both known DRM features and sequences containing at least one known DRM, our classifiers lose all prediction accuracy. These results likely indicate that all mutations directly conferring resistance have been found, and that our newly discovered DRMs are accessory or compensatory mutations. Moreover, apart from the accessory nature of the relationships we found, we did not find any significant signal of further, more subtle epistasis combining several mutations which individually do not seem to confer any resistance.},

  abstract   = {The retroelements are as diverse an assemblage of related molecular entities as can be found anywhere. With the exception of the retroviruses themselves, retroelements are genetic parasites that inhabit the genomes of all eukaryotes and many prokaryotes. The infectious retroviruses can be considered a highly evolved pinnacle on the complex phylogenetic tree that makes up the retroelements. The root of this tree is believed by many to be an ancient cellular reverse transcriptase gene, as originally proposed by Temin (1980), although this remains controversial. It is useful to consider the retroelements in comparison to the infectious retroviruses. The retroelement types, summarized in Table 1, include the endogenous retroviruses, the retrotransposons, the “retrotranscripts” (including the Alu-like sequences and the processed pseudogenes), and the prokaryotic retrons (also known as multicopy single-stranded DNAs [msDNAs]). Retroelements are known primarily as mobile DNA species integrated at various positions in the genomes of their host species, although most of them also have important extrachromosomal DNA forms. From the mitochondrial and chloroplast compartments of various organisms, the mobile group II introns (referred to here as retrointrons) and the retroplasmids are recognized as retroelements. Yet another major grouping of retroelements is the “pararetroviruses,” a group of true viruses with DNA genomes that, in a curious permutation of the retroviral life cycle, replicate via a cellular RNA intermediate but do not normally integrate into the host genome.},

  abstract     = {Introduction Pre-treatment HIV drug resistance (PDR) is an increasing problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Children are an especially vulnerable population to develop PDR given that paediatric second-line treatment options are limited. Although monitoring of PDR is important, data on the paediatric prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa and its consequences for treatment outcomes are scarce. We designed a prospective paediatric cohort study to document the prevalence of PDR and its effect on subsequent treatment failure in Nigeria, the country with the second highest number of HIV-infected children in the world. Methods HIV-1-infected children ≤12 years, who had not been exposed to drugs for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), were enrolled between 2012 and 2013, and followed up for 24 months in Lagos, Nigeria. Pre-antiretroviral treatment (ART) population-based pol genotypic testing and six-monthly viral load (VL) testing were performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effect of PDR (World Health Organization (WHO) list for transmitted drug resistance) on subsequent treatment failure (two consecutive VL measurements {$>$}1000 cps/ml or death). Results Of the total 82 PMTCT-naïve children, 13 (15.9\%) had PDR. All 13 children harboured non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations, of whom seven also had nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance. After 24 months, 33\% had experienced treatment failure. Treatment failure was associated with PDR and a higher log VL before treatment initiation (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 7.53 (95\%CI 1.61–35.15) and 2.85 (95\%CI 1.04–7.78), respectively). Discussion PDR was present in one out of six Nigerian children. These high numbers corroborate with recent findings in other African countries. The presence of PDR was relevant as it was the strongest predictor of first-line treatment failure. Conclusions Our findings stress the importance of implementing fully active regimens in children living with HIV. This includes the implementation of protease inhibitor (PI)-based first-line ART, as is recommended by the WHO for all HIV-infected children {$<$}3 years of age. Overcoming practical barriers to implement PI-based regimens is essential to ensure optimal treatment for HIV-infected children in sub-Saharan Africa. In countries where individual VL or resistance testing is not possible, more attention should be given to paediatric PDR surveys.},

  abstract  = {Motivation: Predicting HIV resistance to drugs is one of many problems for which bioinformaticians have implemented and trained machine learning methods, such as neural networks. Predicting HIV resistance would be much easier if we could directly use the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the targeted protein sequences, but unfortunately we rarely have enough structural information available to train a neural network. Furthermore, prediction of the 3D structure of a protein is not straightforward. However, characteristics related to the 3D structure can be used to train a machine learning algorithm as an alternative to take into account the information of the protein folding in the 3D space. Here, starting from this philosophy, we select the amino acid energies as features to predict HIV drug resistance, using a specific topology of a neural network.},

  abstract     = {Viral genetic sequencing can be used to monitor the spread of HIV drug resistance, identify appropriate antiretroviral regimes, and characterize transmission dynamics. Despite decreasing costs, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is still prohibitively costly for routine use in generalized HIV epidemics in low- and middle-income countries. Here, we present veSEQ-HIV, a high-throughput, cost-effective NGS sequencing method and computational pipeline tailored specifically to HIV, which can be performed using leftover blood drawn for routine CD4 cell count testing. This method overcomes several major technical challenges that have prevented HIV sequencing from being used routinely in public health efforts; it is fast, robust, and cost-efficient, and generates full genomic sequences of diverse strains of HIV without bias. The complete veSEQ-HIV pipeline provides viral load estimates and quantitative summaries of drug resistance mutations; it also exploits information on within-host viral diversity to construct directed transmission networks. We evaluated the method’s performance using 1,620 plasma samples collected from individuals attending 10 large urban clinics in Zambia as part of the HPTN 071-2 study (PopART Phylogenetics). Whole HIV genomes were recovered from 91\% of samples with a viral load of {$>$}1,000 copies/ml. The cost of the assay (30 GBP per sample) compares favorably with existing VL and HIV genotyping tests, proving an affordable option for combining HIV clinical monitoring with molecular epidemiology and drug resistance surveillance in low-income settings.},

@article{boyerSelectiveExcisionAZTMP2001,
  abstract     = {Two distinct mechanisms can be envisioned for resistance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) to nucleoside analogs: one in which the mutations interfere with the ability of HIV-1 RT to incorporate the analog, and the other in which the mutations enhance the excision of the analog after it has been incorporated. It has been clear for some time that there are mutations that selectively interfere with the incorporation of nucleoside analogs; however, it has only recently been proposed that zidovudine (AZT) resistance can involve the excision of the nucleoside analog after it has been incorporated into viral DNA. Although this proposal resolves some important issues, it leaves some questions unanswered. In particular, how do the AZT resistance mutations enhance excision, and what mechanism(s) causes the excision reaction to be relatively specific for AZT? We have used both structural and biochemical data to develop a model. In this model, several of the mutations associated with AZT resistance act primarily to enhance the binding of ATP, which is the most likely pyrophosphate donor in the in vivo excision reaction. The AZT resistance mutations serve to increase the affinity of RT for ATP so that, at physiological ATP concentrations, excision is reasonably efficient. So far as we can determine, the specificity of the excision reaction for an AZT-terminated primer is not due to the mutations that confer resistance, but depends instead on the structure of the region around the HIV-1 RT polymerase active site and on its interactions with the azido group of AZT. Steric constraints involving the azido group cause the end of an AZT 5′-monophosphate-terminated primer to preferentially reside at the nucleotide binding site, which favors excision.},

@article{brentjensHumanPapillomavirusReview2002,
  abstract     = {Thimerosal has been widely used as a preservative in human vaccines for decades. Thimerosal, a thiol capping agent with ethyl mercury being the active degradant, could have impacts on the vaccine potency due to potential thiol modification. The effects on the antigenicity and immunogenicity of human papillomavirus (HPV) virus-like particles (VLPs) in the presence of thimerosal was studied. In general, reduced binding activity was observed between HPV antigens and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) upon thimerosal treatment, accompanied by reduced protein conformational stability. The immunogenicity of a pentavalent vaccine formulation (HPV6, HPV11, HPV16, HPV18 and hepatitis E virus) with or without thimerosal was studied in mice. The functional antibody titres, as well as the binding titres, were determined, showing a substantial decrease for vaccine formulations containing thimerosal for HPV16/18. Similarly, epitope-specific competition assays using specific and functional mAbs as tracers also showed a significant reduction in immunogenicity for HPV16/18 in the presence of thimerosal. Structural alterations in the capsid protein for HPV18 were observed with cryo-electron microscopy and 3-dimensional reconstruction in the comparative structural analysis. The results should alert scientists in formulation development field on the choice for vaccine preservatives, in particular for thiol-containing antigens. Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and it is estimated that Human papillomavirus (HPV) related cancers account for 5\% of all human cancers. Current HPV vaccines are extremely effective at preventing infection and neoplastic disease; however, they are prophylactic and do not clear established infections. Therapeutic vaccines which trigger cell-mediated immune responses for the treatment of established infections and malignancies are therefore required. The E6 and E7 early genes are ideal targets for vaccine therapy due to their role in disruption of the cell cycle and their constitutive expression in premalignant and malignant tissues. Several strategies have been investigated for the development of therapeutic vaccines, including live-vector, nucleic acid, peptide, protein-based and cell-based vaccines as well as combinatorial approaches, with several vaccine candidates progressing to clinical trials. With the current understanding of the HPV life cycle, molecular mechanisms of infection, carcinogenesis, tumour biology, the tumour microenvironment and immune response mechanisms, an approved HPV therapeutic vaccine seems to be a goal not far from being achieved. In this article, the status of therapeutic HPV vaccines in clinical trials are reviewed, and the potential for plant-based vaccine production platforms described. Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is a key factor in the development of precancerous lesions and invasive cervical cancer. Prophylactic vaccines to immunize against HPV are an effective approach to reducing HPV related disease burden. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity and dosage effect of a trivalent HPV 16/18/58 vaccine (3vHPV) produced in Escherichia coli (E.coli), with Gardasil quadrivalent vaccine (4vHPV, Merck \& Co.) as a positive control. Sera collected from rhesus macaques vaccinated with three dosage formulations of 3vHPV (termed low-, mid-, and high-dosage formulations, respectively), and the 4vHPV vaccine were analyzed by both Pseudovirus-Based Neutralization Assay (PBNA) and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Strong immune responses against HPV 16/18/58 were successfully elicited, and dosage-dependence was observed, with likely occurrence of immune interference between different L1-VLP antigens. HPV 16/18 specific neutralizing antibody (nAb) and total immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses in rhesus macaques receiving 3vHPV at the three dosages tested were generally non-inferior to those observed in rhesus macaques receiving 4vHPV throughout the study period. Particularly, HPV 18 nAb titers induced by the mid-dosage formulation that contained the same amounts of HPV 16/18 L1-VLPs as Gardasil 4vHPV were between 7.3 to 12.7-fold higher compared to the positive control arm from weeks 24–64. The durability of antibody responses specific to HPV 16/18 elicited by 3vHPV vaccines was also shown to be non-inferior to that associated with Gardasil 4vHPV. To detect human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, p21 oncogene, DNA content of urothelial cells in different bladder lesions with and without schistosomiasis and to correlate them with histopathological grade and stage. Eighty-five patients were enrolled: 25 chronic cystitis and 60 malignant bladder lesions; 15 schistosomal squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC), 45 urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma TCC) schistosomal and non-scistosomal. Ten healthy individuals served as controls. Genotyping of HPV 6/11 and 16/18 were done using in situ hybridization and p21 protein expression by Immunohistochemical technique in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. DNA content of urothelial cells were stained with felugen stains and measured using Automated Image analysis System. HPV DNA 6/11 and 16/18 expression was increased from cases of schistosomal cystitis with dysplasia to TCC with schistosomiasis compared to TCC and SQCC. The expression increased with statistical significance in invasive TCC and high-grade compared with superficial and low grade. Over-expression of p21 in invasive TCC group was compared with superficial TCC, high-grade TCC was compared low grade and TCC was compared with SQCC. Almost all cases of TCC associated with schistosomiasis exhibit aneuploid histogram compared to SQCC and all invasive TCC exhibited aneuploid histograms. Both HPV infection and p21 gene abnormalities may contribute to bilharzial bladder carcinogenesis. DNA image cytometric features may predict stage progression in TCC. Expression of p21, DNA HPV 6/11 and 16/18 may be used as biological markers of bladder carcinoma. The role of sleep in patients diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome is not fully understood. Studies of polysomnographic and quantitative sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) measures have provided contradictory results, with few consistent findings in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). For the most part, it appears that delta EEG activity may provide the best discrimination between patients and healthy controls. A closer examination of delta activity in the very slow end of the frequency band is still to be considered in assessing sleep in CFS. The present preliminary study compared absolute and relative spectral power in conventional EEG bands and ultra-slow delta (0.5–0.8 Hz) between 10 young female patients with the CFS and healthy controls without psychopathology. In absolute measures, the ultra-slow delta power was lower in CFS, about one-fifth that of the control group. Other frequency bands did not differ between groups. Relative ultra-slow delta power was lower in patients than in controls. CFS is associated with lower ultra-slow (0.5–0.8 Hz) delta power, underscoring the importance of looking beyond conventional EEG frequency bands. From a neurophysiological standpoint, lower ultra-slow wave power may indicate abnormalities in the oscillations in membrane potential or a failure in neural recruitment in those with CFS. Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN) is a significant complication after kidney transplantation, often leading to premature graft loss. In order to identify antiviral responses of the renal tubular epithelium, we studied activation of the viral DNA and the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensors Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) in allograft biopsy samples of patients with PVAN, and in human collecting duct cells in culture after stimulation by the dsRNA mimic polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), cytokines, or infection with BK virus. Double staining using immunofluorescence for BK virus and TLR3 showed strong signals in epithelial cells of distal cortical tubules and the collecting duct. In biopsies microdissected to isolate tubulointerstitial lesions, TLR3 but not RIG-I mRNA expression was found to be increased in PVAN. Collecting duct cells in culture expressed TLR3 intracellularly, and activation of TLR3 and RIG-I by poly(I:C) enhanced expression of cytokine, chemokine, and IFN-β mRNA. This inflammatory response could be specifically blocked by siRNA to TLR3. Finally, infection of the collecting duct cells with BK virus enhanced the expression of cytokines and chemokines. This led to an efficient antiviral immune response with TLR3 and RIG-I upregulation without activation of IL-1β or components of the inflammasome pathway. Thus, PVAN activation of innate immune defense mechanisms through TLR3 is involved in the antiviral and anti-inflammatory response leading to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), usually HPV types 6 and 11. The conventional method used for detection and typing the RRP isolates in our laboratory is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing method. A real-time PCR assay based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe technology was developed for the detection and rapid genotyping of HPV-6 and-11 isolates from biopsy material. The primers and probes were designed using multiple alignments of HPV-6 and HPV-11 partial E6 and E7 sequences that included prototypic and non-prototypic variants. Real-time PCR followed by probe-specific melting-curve analysis allowed differentiation of HPV-6 and HPV-11. HPV-6 and HPV-11 amplicons were used to determine detection limits and inter- and intra-assay variability. The detection limit of the assay was 12.8 DNA copies for HPV-6 and 22.5 DNA copies for HPV-11. A total of 60 isolates were genotyped using the FRET real-time PCR assay and a 100\% concordance was obtained when results were compared with genotyping based on conventional DNA sequencing. The real-time PCR assay based on FRET technology was able to detect and rapidly genotype HPV from tissue biopsy obtained from patients with RRP. The assay reduces the time required for genotyping from three working days to less than a day. Polyomaviruses are ubiquitous, species-specific viruses belonging to the family Papovaviridae. The two most commonly known human polyomaviruses, BK virus and JC virus were first described in the 1970s. Newer human polyomaviruses, namely KI polyoma virus, WU polyoma virus and Merkel cell polyoma virus were identified in the last five years. Most humans encounter BK and JC virus during childhood, causing mild illness. However, when reactivated or acquired in the immunocompromised host, BK and JC virus have been implicated in a number of human clinical disease states. BK is most commonly associated with renal involvement, such as ureteral stenosis, hemorrhagic cystitis and nephropathy. Less commonly, it is associated with pneumonitis, retinitis, liver disease and meningoencephalitis. JC virus is most well known for its association with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and is possibly implicated in the development of various human neoplasms. The following chapter will outline the basic virology, epidemiology and clinical manifestations of BK and JC virus and discuss relevant diagnostic and treatment options. Model systems show that papillomavirus DNA can persist after lesion-regression, and be maintained in a subset of epithelial basal cells. These are very likely long-lived ‘stem-cells’ or ‘stem-like cells’, with latency arising via at least two distinct mechanisms. The first involves low-titre virus infection and the retention of viral DNA at levels that are too low to allow life-cycle completion. The second involves lesion-formation, and clearance by the adaptive immune system, followed by persistence with low-level viral gene expression, and possible reactivation upon immune depletion. Mechanical irritation, inflammation and other extracellular influences affect viral copy number in the latently infected cell, and may predispose to lesion-reappearance. Reactivation may account for the recurrence of ‘apparently cleared’ cervical lesions caused by high-risk types, the appearance of Beta HPV-lesions following immunosuppression, and the development of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis in afflicted children.},

  abstract     = {Motivation: Read simulators combined with alignment evaluation tools provide the most straightforward way to evaluate and compare mappers. Simulation of reads is accompanied by information about their positions in the source genome. This information is then used to evaluate alignments produced by the mapper. Finally, reports containing statistics of successful read alignments are created. In default of standards for encoding read origins, every evaluation tool has to be made explicitly compatible with the simulator used to generate reads.Results: To solve this obstacle, we have created a generic format Read Naming Format (R nf ) for assigning read names with encoded information about original positions. Futhermore, we have developed an associated software package R nf Tools containing two principal components. MIS hmash applies one of popular read simulating tools (among D wg S im , A rt , M ason , C u R e S im , etc.) and transforms the generated reads into R nf format. LAVE nder evaluates then a given read mapper using simulated reads in R nf format. A special attention is payed to mapping qualities that serve for parametrization of R oc curves, and to evaluation of the effect of read sample contamination.

In previous studies, the antisense transcript has been identified both in various HIV-infected cell lines and in leukocytes of HIV-1+ patients. The expression of the corresponding antisense protein (ASP) during natural HIV-1 infection has been indirectly evidenced by the identification of anti-ASP antibodies in the sera of HIV+ patients. We have used immunoelectron microscopy procedures (ultrasmall gold particles coupled to silver enhancement) to establish direct evidence of ASP production. ASP has then been detected in chronically and acutely HIV-1-infected cell lines. The protein, found mostly associated with various cellular membranes as well as with the virions released from the cells, indicated that ASP is a bona fide component for the virions and may participate in the particle formation.},

In practice, generalizability is frequently estimated by averaging the accuracies obtained on individual cross-validation folds. This procedure, however, is problematic in two ways. First, it does not allow for the derivation of meaningful confidence intervals. Second, it leads to an optimistic estimate when a biased classifier is tested on an imbalanced dataset. We show that both problems can be overcome by replacing the conventional point estimate of accuracy by an estimate of the posterior distribution of the balanced accuracy.},

@article{brouwerFeedforwardNetworkInput2002,
  abstract     = {The data on which a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is to be trained to approximate a continuous function may have inputs that are categorical rather than numeric or quantitative such as color, gender, race, etc. A categorical variable causes a discontinuous relationship between an input variable and the output. A MLP, with connection matrices that multiply input values and sigmoid functions that further transform values, represents a continuous mapping in all input variables. A MLP therefore requires that all inputs correspond to numeric, continuously valued variables and represents a continuous function in all input variables. The way that this problem is usually dealt with is to replace the categorical values by numeric ones and treat them as if they were continuously valued. However, there is no meaningful correspondence between the continuous quantities generated this way and the original categorical values. Another approach is to encode the categorical portion of the input using 1-out-of-n encoding and include this code as input to the MLP. The approach in this paper is to segregate categorical variables from the continuous independent variables completely. The MLP is trained with multiple outputs; a separate output unit for each of the allowed combination of values of the categorical independent variables. During training the categorical value or combination of categorical values determines which of the output units should have the target value on it, with the remaining outputs being ‘do not care’. Three data sets were used for comparison of methods. Results show that this approach is much more effective than the conventional approach of assigning continuous variables to the categorical features. In case of the data set where there were several categorical variables the method proposed here is also more effective than the 1-out-of-n input method.},

  abstract  = {We present the first sub-quadratic time algorithm that with high probability correctly reconstructs phylogenetic trees for short sequences generated by a Markov model of evolution. Due to rapid expansion in sequence databases, such very fast algorithms are necessary. Other fast heuristics have been developed for building trees from large alignments [18,1], but they lack theoretical performance guarantees. Our new algorithm runs in O(n 1 + γ(g)log2 n) time, where γ is an increasing function of an upper bound on the branch lengths in the phylogeny, the upper bound g must be below 1/2-\textbackslash sqrt\{1/8\} \textbackslash approx 0.151/2-\textbackslash sqrt\{1/8\} \textbackslash approx 0.15, and γ(g) {$<$} 1 for all g. For phylogenies with very short branches, the running time of our algorithm is near-linear. For example, if all branches have mutation probability less than 0.02, the running time of our algorithm is roughly O(n 1.2log2 n). Our preliminary experiments show that many large phylogenies can be reconstructed more accurately than allowed by current methods, in comparable running times.},

We examined the effect of each of these factors on familywise and false negative error rates and compared the false negative error rates of methods with an acceptable familywise error. Only four methods were not bettered in this comparison. Unfortunately, however, a uniformly best method of those examined does not exist. A suggested strategy for examining corrections uses a succession of methods that are increasingly lax in familywise error.

Mutations in the RT domain that had previously been associated with antiretroviral resistance were not shared by these strains. We have analyzed by logistic regression 46 variable amino acid sites in RT for their effect on susceptibility and have identified two novel sites influencing susceptibility to NNRTIs: amino acids 135 and 283 in RT. Eight different combinations of amino acids at these sites were observed among these patients. These combinations showed a 14-fold range in mean susceptibility to both nevirapine and delavirdine.

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to perform exceptionally well in a variety of tasks, including biological sequence classification. Available implementations, however, are usually optimized for a particular task and difficult to reuse. To enable researchers to utilize these networks more easily, we implemented pysster, a Python package for training CNNs on biological sequence data. Sequences are classified by learning sequence and structure motifs and the package offers an automated hyper-parameter optimization procedure and options to visualize learned motifs along with information about their positional and class enrichment. The package runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU and provides a simple interface to train and evaluate a network with a handful lines of code. Using an RNA A-to-I editing dataset and cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-seq binding site sequences, we demonstrate that pysster classifies sequences with higher accuracy than previous methods, such as GraphProt or ssHMM, and is able to recover known sequence and structure motifs.pysster is freely available at https://github.com/budach/pysster.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract  = {Endogenous or surrogate ligands of a vast number of proteins remain unknown. Identification of small molecules that bind to these orphan proteins will not only shed new light into their biological functions but also provide new opportunities for drug discovery. Deep learning plays an increasing role in the prediction of chemical-protein interactions, but it faces several challenges in protein deorphanization. Bioassay data are highly biased to certain proteins, making it difficult to train a generalizable machine learning model for the proteins that are dissimilar from the ones in the training data set. Pre-training offers a general solution to improving the model generalization, but needs incorporation of domain knowledge and customization of task-specific supervised learning. To address these challenges, we develop a novel protein pre-training method, DIstilled Sequence Alignment Embedding (DISAE), and a module-based fine-tuning strategy for the protein deorphanization. In the benchmark studies, DISAE significantly improves the generalizability and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with a large margin. The interpretability analysis of pre-trained model suggests that it learns biologically meaningful information. We further use DISAE to assign ligands to 649 human orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) and to cluster the human GPCRome by integrating their phylogenetic and ligand relationships. The promising results of DISAE open an avenue for exploring the chemical landscape of entire sequenced genomes.},

  abstract     = {It has been suggested that RNA viruses and other subcellular entities endowed with RNA genomes are relicts from an ancient RNA/protein World which is believed to have preceded extant DNA/RNA/protein-based cells. According to their proponents, this possibility is supported by the small-genome sizes of RNA viruses and their manifold replication strategies, which have been interpreted as the result of an evolutionary exploration of different alternative genome organizations and replication strategies during early evolutionary stages. At the other extreme are the giant DNA viruses, whose genome sizes can be as large as those of some prokaryotes, and which have been grouped by some authors into a fourth domain of life. As argued here, the comparative analysis of the chemical nature and sizes of the viral genomes reported in GenBank does not reveal any obvious correlation with the phylogenetic history of their hosts. Accordingly, it is somewhat difficult to reconcile the proposal of the putative pre-DNA antiquity of RNA viruses, with their extraordinary diversity in plant hosts and their apparent absence among the Archaea. Other issues related to the genome size of all known viruses and subviral agents and the relationship with their hosts are discussed.},

These nt acted as substrates with several DNA polymerases leading to chain termination. Upon alkali or enzymatic treatment of the terminated DNA chain, free 3′-hydroxyl groups were recovered and found able to undergo chain extension when incubated with a mixture of dNTPs and a DNA polymerase. Because each tag has different fluorescent properties in itself i.e., as a free acid, it theoretically is possible, after removal and characterization of the tag, to infer which nt has been inserted. Reiteration of the process can then be used to determine a nt sequence with a non-gelbased method amenable to automation.},

  abstract   = {Viruses are infectious obligate intracellular parasites consisting of an RNA or DNA genome in a protective coat. Virus particles cannot increase in size but are assembled from pre-formed components in susceptible host cells. The assembly of virus particles is achieved by the information contained within the components of the particle, a process driven by the rules of symmetry and by the most thermodynamically stable configuration. Once formed, virus particles vary in stability, some being very fragile while others are extremely stable, enabling some viruses to maintain the infectivity of their genome for extended periods of time outside a host cell, a feature required by viruses which are transmitted environmentally rather than directly from host to host. The outer surface of the virus particle must be able to interact with a suitable host cell to enable the process of infection to occur. Key Concepts Virus particles (virions) are assembled from pre-formed components and do not grow or divide. The virus coat protects the virus genome from degradation and helps maintain infectivity. The assembly of virus particles is driven by the components making up the particle and is driven by symmetry and thermodynamics. In some cases, temporary “scaffolding proteins” are used to help direct the assembly of the particle into the mature form. Virus particles must interact with the host cell to establish the process of infection. Virus particles vary in stability, some being very fragile while others are very tough and able to persist in the environment for extended periods of time.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology allows us to determine the sequence of nucleotides of many millions of DNA molecules in parallel. Accompanied by a dramatic reduction in cost since its introduction in 2004, NGS technology has provided a new way of addressing a wide range of biological and biomedical questions, from the study of human genetic disease to the analysis of gene expression, protein-DNA interactions, and patterns of DNA methylation. The data generated by NGS instruments comprise huge numbers of very short DNA sequences, or “reads,” that carry little information by themselves. These reads therefore have to be pieced together by well-engineered algorithms to reconstruct biologically meaningful measurements, such as the level of expression of a gene. To solve this complex, high-dimensional puzzle, reads must be mapped back to a reference genome to determine their origin. Due to sequencing errors and to genuine differences between the reference genome and the individual being sequenced, this mapping process must be tolerant of mismatches, insertions, and deletions. Although optimal alignment algorithms to solve this problem have long been available, the practical requirements of aligning hundreds of millions of short reads to the 3-billion-base-pair-long human genome have stimulated the development of new, more efficient methods, which today are used routinely throughout the world for the analysis of NGS data.},

  abstract  = {Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been an explosion of sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, making it the most widely sequenced virus in the history. Several databases and tools have been created to keep track of genome sequences and variants of the virus, most notably the GISAID platform hosts millions of complete genome sequences, and it is continuously expanding every day. A challenging task is the development of fast and accurate tools that are able to distinguish between the different SARS-CoV-2 variants and assign them to a clade. Results: In this paper, we leverage the Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop an original method that learns how to classify genome sequences that we implement into CouGaR-g, a tool for the clade assignment problem on SARS-CoV-2 sequences. On a testing subset of the GISAID, CouGaR-g achieves an 96.29\% overall accuracy, while a similar tool, Covidex, obtained a 77,12\% overall accuracy. As far as we know, our method is the first using Deep Learning and FCGR for intra-species classification. Furthermore, by using some feature importance methods CouGaR-g allows to identify k-mers that matches SARS-CoV-2 marker variants. Conclusions: By combining FCGR and CNNs, we develop a method that achieves a better accuracy than Covidex (which is based on Random Forest) for clade assignment of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, also thanks to our training on a much larger dataset, with comparable running times. Our method implemented in CouGaR-g is able to detect k-mers that capture relevant biological information that distinguishes the clades, known as marker variants. Availability: The trained models can be tested online providing a FASTA file (with one or multiple sequences) at https://huggingface.co/spaces/BIASLab/sars-cov-2-classification-fcgr. CouGaR-g is also available at https://github.com/AlgoLab/CouGaR-g under the GPL.},

@article{cartwrightLogarithmicGapCosts2006,
  abstract     = {Background Studies on the distribution of indel sizes have consistently found that they obey a power law. This finding has lead several scientists to propose that logarithmic gap costs, G (k) = a + c ln k, are more biologically realistic than affine gap costs, G (k) = a + bk, for sequence alignment. Since quick and efficient affine costs are currently the most popular way to globally align sequences, the goal of this paper is to determine whether logarithmic gap costs improve alignment accuracy significantly enough the merit their use over the faster affine gap costs. Results A group of simulated sequences pairs were globally aligned using affine, logarithmic, and log-affine gap costs. Alignment accuracy was calculated by comparing resulting alignments to actual alignments of the sequence pairs. Gap costs were then compared based on average alignment accuracy. Log-affine gap costs had the best accuracy, followed closely by affine gap costs, while logarithmic gap costs performed poorly. Subsequently a model was developed to explain the results. Conclusion In contrast to initial expectations, logarithmic gap costs produce poor alignments and are actually not implied by the power-law behavior of gap sizes, given typical match and mismatch costs. Furthermore, affine gap costs not only produce accurate alignments but are also good approximations to biologically realistic gap costs. This work provides added confidence for the biological relevance of existing alignment algorithms.},

Here we present an expectation–maximization algorithm built on a pair hidden Markov model that is able to properly handle indels in neutrally evolving DNA sequences. From a data set of orthologous introns, we estimate relative rates and length distributions of indels among primates and rodents. This technique has the advantage of potentially handling large genomic data sets. We find that a zeta power-law model of indel lengths provides a much better fit than the traditional geometric model and that indel processes are conserved between our taxa. The estimated relative rates are about 12–16 indels per 100 substitutions, and the estimated power-law magnitudes are about 1.6–1.7. More significantly, we find that using the traditional geometric/affine model of indel lengths introduces artifacts into evolutionary analysis, casting doubt on studies of the evolution and diversity of indel formation using traditional models and invalidating measures of species divergence that include indel lengths.},

We have generalized a previous model by Bretscher and coworkers in order to explore different implementations of phenotypic mixing and more realistic demographic and selective regimes. Using computer simulations we show that the effect of recombination on the evolution of drug resistance depends strongly on the intensity of selection, as well as on the viral population size. Under the high selection pressure expected during antiretroviral therapy, the strength of the Hill-Robertson effect increases and recombination favors the evolution of resistance under a wide range of population sizes, independently of the sign of the epistatic interaction. Our results suggest that recombination plays an important role in the evolution of drug resistance in HIV-1 under various realistic scenarios. These findings could be taken into account in order to develop optimal HIV-1 drug treatments.},

  abstract     = {The biological activity of a protein typically depends on the presence of a small number of functional residues. Identifying these residues from the amino acid sequences alone would be useful. Classically, strictly conserved residues are predicted to be functional but often conservation patterns are more complicated. Here, we present a novel method that exploits such patterns for the prediction of functional residues. The method uses a simple but powerful representation of entire proteins, as well as sequence residues as vectors in a generalised `sequence space'. Projection of these vectors onto a lower-dimensional space reveals groups of residues specific for particular subfamilies that are predicted to be directly involved in protein function. Based on the method we present testable predictions for sets of functional residues in SH2 domains and in the conserved box of cyclins.},

  abstract     = {Recent experiments provide sound arguments in favor of the in vivo expression of the AntiSense Protein (ASP) of HIV-1. This putative protein is encoded on the antisense strand of the provirus genome and entirely overlapped by the env gene with reading frame −2. The existence of ASP was suggested in 1988, but is still controversial, and its function has yet to be determined. We used a large dataset of ∼23,000 HIV-1 and SIV sequences to study the origin, evolution, and conservation of the asp gene. We found that the ASP ORF is specific to group M of HIV-1, which is responsible for the human pandemic. Moreover, the correlation between the presence of asp and the prevalence of HIV-1 groups and M subtypes appeared to be statistically significant. We then looked for evidence of selection pressure acting on asp. Using computer simulations, we showed that the conservation of the ASP ORF in the group M could not be due to chance. Standard methods were ineffective in disentangling the two selection pressures imposed by both the Env and ASP proteins—an expected outcome with overlaps in frame −2. We thus developed a method based on careful evolutionary analysis of the presence/absence of stop codons, revealing that ASP does impose significant selection pressure. All of these results support the idea that asp is the 10th gene of HIV-1 group M and indicate a correlation with the spread of the pandemic.},

We also propose another method, called hierarchical algorithm, that provides an approximation to the estimator when the sample size increases and runs in time O\{mln(m)n\}. Our main theoretical results are the strong consistency of both estimators when the sample size n grows to infinity. We illustrate the convergence of these algorithms through some simulation examples and we apply the method to identify recombination hotspots in real SNPs data.},

Our novel surface chemistry approach ensures accurate identification of correct bases at individual positions along a targeted DNA sequence on the gold surface. Binding of the correct base on the gold sensing surface triggers strong spectral variations within the nanohole optical response, which provides a high signal-to-noise ratio and accurate sequence data. Integrating our label-free sequencing platform with a lens-free imaging-based device, we reliably determined targeted DNA sequences by monitoring the changes within the plasmonic diffraction images. Consequently, this new label-free surface chemistry technique, integrated with plasmonic lens-free imaging platform, will enable monitoring multiple biomolecular binding events, which could initiate new avenues for high-throughput nucleic acid sequencing.},

Fortunately, recent survey reports that the state-of-the-art aligners are already fast enough to handle the ultra amount of short sequence reads in the reasonable time. However, for aligning the long sequence reads ({$>$}400 bp) generated by the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, it is still quite inefficient with present aligners. Furthermore, the challenge becomes more and more serious as the lengths and the amounts of the sequence reads are both keeping increasing with the improvement of the sequencing technology. Thus, it is extremely urgent for the researchers to enhance the performance of the long read alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel FPGA-based system to improve the efficiency of the long read mapping. Compared to the state-of-the-art long read aligner BWA-SW, our accelerating platform could achieve a high performance with almost the same sensitivity. Experiments demonstrate that, for reads with lengths ranging from 512 up to 4,096 base pairs, the described system obtains a 10x -48x speedup for the bottleneck of the software. As to the whole mapping procedure, the FPGA-based platform could achieve a 1.8x -3:3x speedup versus the BWA-SW aligner, reducing the alignment cycles from weeks to days.},

To test this hypothesis, SIVs from eight sooty mangabeys, including six new viruses from West Africa, were genetically characterized. gag and env sequences showed that while the viruses of all eight sooty mangabeys belonged to the SIVsm/HIV-2 family, each was widely divergent from SIVs found earlier in captive monkeys at American primate centers. In two SIVs from sooty mangabeys discovered about 100 miles (ca. 161 Km) from each other in rural West Africa, the amino acids of a conserved gag p17-p26 region differed by 19.3\%, a divergence greater than that in four of five clades of HIV-2 and in SIVs found in other African monkey species. Analysis of gag region sequences showed that feral mangabeys in one small troop harbored four distinct SIVs. Three of the newly found viruses were genetically divergent, showing as much genetic distance from each other as from the entire SIVsm/HIV-2 family. Sequencing and heteroduplex analysis of one feral animal-derived SIV showed a mosaic genome containing an env gene that was homologous with other feral SIVsm env genes in the troop but having a gag gene from another, distinct SIV. Surprisingly a gag phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences showed that the African relatives closest to all three household-derived SIVs were HIV-2 subtypes D and E from humans in the same West African areas. In one case, the SIV/HIV-2 cluster was from the same village. The findings support the hypothesis that each HIV-2 subtype in West Africans originated from widely divergent SIVsm strains, transmitted by independent cross-species events in the same geographic locations.},

  abstract     = {As a fundamental task in bioinformatics, searching for massive short patterns over a long text has been accelerated by various compressed full-text indexes. These indexes are able to provide similar searching functionalities to classical indexes, e.g. suffix trees and suffix arrays, while requiring less space. For genomic data, a well-known family of compressed full-text indexes, called FM-indexes, presents unmatched performance in practice. One major drawback of FM-indexes is that their locating operations, which report all occurrence positions of patterns in a given text, are not efficient, especially for the patterns with many occurrences.In this paper, we introduce a novel locating algorithm, FMtree, to fast retrieve all occurrence positions of any pattern via FM-indexes. When searching for a pattern over a given text, FMtree organizes the search space of the locating operation into a conceptual multiway tree. As a result, multiple occurrence positions of this pattern can be retrieved simultaneously by traversing the multiway tree. Compared with existing locating algorithms, our tree-based algorithm reduces large numbers of redundant operations and presents better data locality. Experimental results show that FMtree is usually one order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms, and still memory-efficient.FMtree is freely available at https://github.com/chhylp123/FMtree.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract     = {Motivation: Recognizing proteins that have similar tertiary structure is the key step of template-based protein structure prediction methods. Traditionally, a variety of alignment methods are used to identify similar folds, based on sequence similarity and sequence-structure compatibility. Although these methods are complementary, their integration has not been thoroughly exploited. Statistical machine learning methods provide tools for integrating multiple features, but so far these methods have been used primarily for protein and fold classification, rather than addressing the retrieval problem of fold recognition-finding a proper template for a given query protein.Results: Here we present a two-stage machine learning, information retrieval, approach to fold recognition. First, we use alignment methods to derive pairwise similarity features for query-template protein pairs. We also use global profile–profile alignments in combination with predicted secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, contact map and beta-strand pairing to extract pairwise structural compatibility features. Second, we apply support vector machines to these features to predict the structural relevance (i.e. in the same fold or not) of the query-template pairs. For each query, the continuous relevance scores are used to rank the templates. The FOLDpro approach is modular, scalable and effective. Compared with 11 other fold recognition methods, FOLDpro yields the best results in almost all standard categories on a comprehensive benchmark dataset. Using predictions of the top-ranked template, the sensitivity is ∼85, 56, and 27\% at the family, superfamily and fold levels respectively. Using the 5 top-ranked templates, the sensitivity increases to 90, 70, and 48\%.Availability: The FOLDpro server is available with the SCRATCH suite through .Contact:pfbaldi@ics.uci.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at},

Here, we review the development of machine learning methods for protein structure prediction, one of the most fundamental problems in structural biology and bioinformatics. Protein structure prediction is such a complex problem that it is often decomposed and attacked at four different levels: 1-D prediction of structural features along the primary sequence of amino acids; 2-D prediction of spatial relationships between amino acids; 3-D prediction of the tertiary structure of a protein; and 4-D prediction of the quaternary structure of a multiprotein complex. A diverse set of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods has been applied over the years to tackle these problems and has significantly contributed to advancing the state-of-the-art of protein structure prediction. In this paper, we review the development and application of hidden Markov models, neural networks, support vector machines, Bayesian methods, and clustering methods in 1-D, 2-D, 3-D, and 4-D protein structure predictions.},

Experimental results indicate that our method correlates well with human perception of visually important regions.},

To employ CNN, the input DNA sequences are required to be encoded as numerical values and represented as either vectors or multi-dimensional matrices. This paper evaluated a simple and more compact ordinal encoding method versus the popular one-hot encoding for DNA sequences. We compared the performances of both encoding methods using three sets of datasets enriched with DNA motifs. We found that the ordinal encoding performs comparable to the one-hot method but with significant reduction in training time. In addition, the one-hot encoding performances were rather consistent across various datasets but would require suitable CNN configuration to perform well. The ordinal encoding with matrix representation performed best in some of the evaluated datasets. This study implied that the performances of CNN for DNA motif discovery depends on the suitable design of the sequence encoding and representation. The good performances of the ordinal encoding method demonstrates that there are still rooms for improvement for the one-hot encoding method.},

However, concern over the cost of training the attention mechanism to learn complex dependencies between distant inputs continues to grow. In response, solutions that exploit the structure and sparsity of the learned attention matrix have blossomed. However, real-world applications that involve long sequences, such as biological sequence analysis, may fall short of meeting these assumptions, precluding exploration of these models. To address this challenge, we present a new Transformer architecture, Performer, based on Fast Attention Via Orthogonal Random features (FAVOR). Our mechanism scales linearly rather than quadratically in the number of tokens in the sequence, is characterized by sub-quadratic space complexity and does not incorporate any sparsity pattern priors. Furthermore, it provides strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased estimation of the attention matrix and uniform convergence. It is also backwards-compatible with pre-trained regular Transformers. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the challenging task of protein sequence modeling and provide detailed theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Summary: Multiple sequence alignment remains a crucial method for understanding the function of groups of related nucleic acid and protein sequences. However, it is known that automatic multiple sequence alignments can often be improved by manual editing. Therefore, tools are needed to view and edit multiple sequence alignments. Due to growth in the sequence databases, multiple sequence alignments can often be large and difficult to view efficiently. The Jalview Java alignment editor is presented here, which enables fast viewing and editing of large multiple sequence alignments.Availability: The Jar file and source code for Jalview is freely available via the World Wide Web at http://www.jalview.org.

In eukaryotic hosts, phages are unable to replicate and in the absence of a suitable prokaryotic host, behave as inert particulate antigens. In recent years, work has shown that whole phage particles can be used to deliver vaccines in the form of immunogenic peptides attached to modified phage coat proteins or as delivery vehicles for DNA vaccines, by incorporating a eukaryotic promoter-driven vaccine gene within their genome. While both approaches are promising by themselves, in future there is also the exciting possibility of creating a hybrid phage combining both components to create phage that are cheap, easy and rapid to produce and that deliver both protein and DNA vaccines via the oral route in the same construct.},

An exonuclease enzyme might be used to cleave individual nucleotide molecules from the DNA, and when coupled to an appropriate detection system, these nucleotides could be identified in the correct order. Here, we show that a protein nanopore with a covalently attached adapter molecule can continuously identify unlabelled nucleoside 5'-monophosphate molecules with accuracies averaging 99.8\%. Methylated cytosine can also be distinguished from the four standard DNA bases: guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine. The operating conditions are compatible with the exonuclease, and the kinetic data show that the nucleotides have a high probability of translocation through the nanopore and, therefore, of not being registered twice. This highly accurate tool is suitable for integration into a system for sequencing nucleic acids and for analysing epigenetic modifications.},

  abstract     = {Background:~         HIV-1 hypersusceptibility to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) improves the response to NNRTI-containing regimens. The genetic basis for NNRTI hypersusceptibility was partly defined in our earlier analyses of a paired genotype\textendash phenotype dataset of viral isolates from treatment-experienced patients, in which we identified reverse transcriptase mutations V118I, H208Y, and T215Y as being strongly associated with NNRTI hypersusceptibility.         Objectives:~         We evaluated the role of these mutations in NNRTI hypersusceptibility by site-directed mutagenesis and phenotypic analysis of HIV-1 recombinants.         Methods:~         Drug susceptibility and replication capacity were determined in single cycle assays. Hypersusceptibility was defined by a statistically significant (P {$<$} 0.01; Student's t-test) mean fold-change in 50\% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of less than 0.4.         Results:~         The single mutations V118I, H208Y, and T215Y did not show hypersusceptibility to efavirenz with mean fold-change of 0.58, 0.55, and 0.70, respectively (P {$<$} 0.01 and P = 0.12). The H208Y/T215Y and V118I/H208Y/T215Y mutants showed marked hypersusceptibility to efavirenz, having mean fold-change values of 0.27 and 0.20, respectively (P {$<$} 0.001). In addition, H208Y/T215Y, V118I/T215Y, and V118I/H208Y/T215Y were hypersusceptible to delavirdine and nevirapine. The V118I/T215Y mutant was not replication impaired; whereas H208Y/T215Y and V118I/H208Y/T215Y had significantly (P {$<$} 0.01) reduced replication capacities of 40 and 35\% of wild-type, respectively.         Conclusion:~         Different combinations of V118I, H208Y, and T215Y produce NNRTI hypersusceptibility. The V118I/T215Y mutant is hypersusceptible to delavirdine and nevirapine without reduced replication capacity, whereas the H208Y/T215Y and V118I/H208Y/T215Y mutants are hypersusceptible to all NNRTI and show impaired replication. These findings suggest that more than one mechanism is involved in NNRTI hypersusceptibility.},

  abstract     = {The global scale-up of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (ART) has led to dramatic reductions in HIV-1 mortality and incidence. However, HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) poses a potential threat to the long-term success of ART and is emerging as a threat to the elimination of AIDS as a public health problem by 2030. In this review we describe the genetic mechanisms, epidemiology, and management of HIVDR at both individual and population levels across diverse economic and geographic settings. To describe the genetic mechanisms of HIVDR, we review the genetic barriers to resistance for the most commonly used ARVs and describe the extent of cross-resistance between them. To describe the epidemiology of HIVDR, we summarize the prevalence and patterns of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and acquired drug resistance (ADR) in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We also review to two categories of HIVDR with important public health relevance: (i) pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR), a World Health Organization-recommended HIVDR surveillance metric and (ii) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-related drug resistance, a type of ADR that can impact clinical outcomes if present at the time of treatment initiation. To summarize the implications of HIVDR for patient management, we review the role of genotypic resistance testing and treatment practices in both high-income and LMIC settings. In high-income countries where drug resistance testing is part of routine care, such an understanding can help clinicians prevent virological failure and accumulation of further HIVDR on an individual level by selecting the most efficacious regimens for their patients. Although there is reduced access to diagnostic testing and to many ARVs in LMIC, understanding the scientific basis and clinical implications of HIVDR is useful in all regions in order to shape appropriate surveillance, inform treatment algorithms, and manage difficult cases.},

In addition to the gag, pol, and env open reading frames (ORFs) present in all retroviruses, lentiviral genomes also contain novel ORFs generally not found in prototypic retroviruses. These ORFs code for a variety of auxiliary proteins which account for the tight and often intricate regulation of gene expression observed in lentiviruses. Auxiliary protein involvement in viral replication has been particularly well characterized in the most extensively studied member of the lentiviral subfamily, the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).},

Initially, a hierarchical clustering of the sequences is performed using the matrix of the pairwise alignment scores. The closest sequences are aligned creating groups of aligned sequences. Then close groups are aligned until all sequences are aligned in one group. The pairwise alignments included in the multiple alignment form a new matrix that is used to produce a hierarchical clustering.

  abstract   = {Attention mechanisms have become ubiquitous in NLP. Recent architectures, notably the Transformer, learn powerful context-aware word representations through layered, multi-headed attention. The multiple heads learn diverse types of word relationships. However, with standard softmax attention, all attention heads are dense, assigning a non-zero weight to all context words. In this work, we introduce the adaptively sparse Transformer, wherein attention heads have flexible, context-dependent sparsity patterns. This sparsity is accomplished by replacing softmax with alpha-entmax: a differentiable generalization of softmax that allows low-scoring words to receive precisely zero weight. Moreover, we derive a method to automatically learn the alpha parameter – which controls the shape and sparsity of alpha-entmax – allowing attention heads to choose between focused or spread-out behavior. Our adaptively sparse Transformer improves interpretability and head diversity when compared to softmax Transformers on machine translation datasets. Findings of the quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach include that heads in different layers learn different sparsity preferences and tend to be more diverse in their attention distributions than softmax Transformers. Furthermore, at no cost in accuracy, sparsity in attention heads helps to uncover different head specializations.},

However, popular machine learning approaches, based on continuous Euclidean spaces, have struggled with the discrete combinatorial formulation of the edit distance that models evolution and the hierarchical relationship that characterises real-world datasets. We present Neural Distance Embeddings (NeuroSEED), a general framework to embed sequences in geometric vector spaces, and illustrate the effectiveness of the hyperbolic space that captures the hierarchical structure and provides an average 38\% reduction in embedding RMSE against the best competing geometry. The capacity of the framework and the significance of these improvements are then demonstrated devising supervised and unsupervised NeuroSEED approaches to multiple core tasks in bioinformatics. Benchmarked with common baselines, the proposed approaches display significant accuracy and/or runtime improvements on real-world datasets. As an example for hierarchical clustering, the proposed pretrained and from-scratch methods match the quality of competing baselines with 30x and 15x runtime reduction, respectively.},

Management of clinical drug resistance requires in depth evaluation, and includes extensive history, physical examination and laboratory studies. Appropriate use of resistance testing provides valuable information useful in constructing regimens for treatment-experienced individuals with viremia during therapy. This review outlines the emergence of drug resistance in vivo, and describes clinical evaluation and therapeutic options of the individual with rebound viremia during therapy.},

For gathering the data, we have used the Aplusix learning environment, which allows students to make freely calculation steps and records all the students' actions. One way to build and update the student model is to precisely follow what the student is doing, by means of a detailed representation of cognitive skills. We are interested in persistent and reproducible actions, i.e., the same action done by a student in different algebraic contexts, rather than in a local student action. For discovering patterns of student behaviours, we use a statistical implicative analysis which makes possible seeking for stability of the actions and determining the contexts where they appear. This theory allows us to build implicative connections between algebraic contexts and actions.},

  abstract     = {Rates of spontaneous mutation critically determine the genetic diversity and evolution of RNA viruses. Although these rates have been characterized in vitro and in cell culture models, they have seldom been determined in vivo for human viruses. Here, we use the intrapatient frequency of premature stop codons to quantify the HIV-1 genome-wide rate of spontaneous mutation in DNA sequences from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This reveals an extremely high mutation rate of (4.1 ± 1.7) × 10−3 per base per cell, the highest reported for any biological entity. Sequencing of plasma-derived sequences yielded a mutation frequency 44 times lower, indicating that a large fraction of viral genomes are lethally mutated and fail to reach plasma. We show that the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase contributes only 2\% of mutations, whereas 98\% result from editing by host cytidine deaminases of the A3 family. Hypermutated viral sequences are less abundant in patients showing rapid disease progression compared to normal progressors, highlighting the antiviral role of A3 proteins. However, the amount of A3-mediated editing varies broadly, and we find that low-edited sequences are more abundant among rapid progressors, suggesting that suboptimal A3 activity might enhance HIV-1 genetic diversity and pathogenesis.},

  abstract  = {Additive tree models (ATMs) are widely used for data mining and machine learning. Important examples of ATMs include random forest, adaboost (with decision trees as weak learners), and gradient boosted trees, and they are often referred to as the best off-the-shelf classifiers. Though capable of attaining high accuracy, ATMs are not well interpretable in the sense that they do not provide actionable knowledge for a given instance. This greatly limits the potential of ATMs on many applications such as medical prediction and business intelligence, where practitioners need suggestions on actions that can lead to desirable outcomes with minimum costs. To address this problem, we present a novel framework to post-process any ATM classifier to extract an optimal actionable plan that can change a given input to a desired class with a minimum cost. In particular, we prove the NP-hardness of the optimal action extraction problem for ATMs and formulate this problem in an integer linear programming formulation which can be efficiently solved by existing packages. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by conducting comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets.},

Both scenarios are typical situations in visual recognition and computational biology. For instance, computer vision and image analysis models can be learned from object-centric internet resources, but are often rather applied to real-world scenes. In computational biology and personalized medicine, training data may be recorded at a particular hospital, but the model is applied to make predictions on data from different hospitals, where patients exhibit a different population structure.

This approach relies on the idea that an entity A will be more specific than or equivalent to an entity B if the vocabulary (i.e. terms and data) used to describe A and its instances tends to be included in that of B and its instances. In order to evaluate such implicative tendencies, this approach makes use of association rule model and Interestingness Measures (IMs) developed in this context. More precisely, we focus on experimental evaluations of IMs for matching ontologies. A set of IMs has been selected according to criteria related to measure properties and semantics. We have performed two experiments on a benchmark composed of two textual taxonomies and a set of reference matching relations between the concepts of the two structures. The first test concerns a comparison of matching accuracy with each of the selected measures. In the second experiment, we compare how each IM evaluates reference relations by studying their value distributions. Results show that the implication intensity delivers the best results.},

(Nature 556(7702):452–456, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0043-0) showed that TD can be a powerful tool to assess the branch support on large phylogenies, thus providing a relevant alternative to Felsenstein’s bootstrap. This distance allows a reference branch\$\$\textbackslash beta \$\$βin a reference tree \$\$\{\textbackslash mathcal \{T\}\}\$\$Tto be compared to a branch b from another tree T (typically a bootstrap tree), both on the same set of n taxa. The TD between these branches is the number of taxa that must be transferred from one side of b to the other in order to obtain \$\$\textbackslash beta \$\$β. By taking the minimum TD from \$\$\textbackslash beta \$\$βto all branches in T we define the transfer index, denoted by \$\$\textbackslash phi (\textbackslash beta ,T)\$\$ϕ(β,T), measuring the degree of agreement of T with \$\$\textbackslash beta \$\$β. Let us consider a reference branch \$\$\textbackslash beta \$\$βhaving p tips on its light side and define the transfer support (TS) as \$\$1 - \textbackslash phi (\textbackslash beta ,T)/(p-1)\$\$1-ϕ(β,T)/(p-1). Lemoine et~al. (2018) used computer simulations to show that the TS defined in this manner is close to 0 for random “bootstrap” trees. In this paper, we demonstrate that result mathematically: when T is randomly drawn, TS converges in probability to 0 when n tends to \$\$\textbackslash infty \$\$∞. Moreover, we fully characterize the distribution of \$\$\textbackslash phi (\textbackslash beta ,T)\$\$ϕ(β,T)on caterpillar trees, indicating that the convergence is fast, and that even when n is small, moderate levels of branch support cannot appear by chance.},

  abstract     = {Summary:~         Although understanding of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance is less clearly established than that of other classes of antiretroviral drugs, certain facts have been established. The treatment-associated genetic mutation profiles of the available NNRTIs have been mapped, and resistance has been found to develop rapidly after initiation of NNRTI therapy. Despite the chemical diversity of the NNRTIs, cross-resistance among agents of this class is nearly universal. Although the viral replicative capacity (“fitness”) of NNRTI-induced viral variants has not been extensively studied, available data suggest that NNRTI-selected mutations confer little damage to viral fitness, and thus a single point mutation produces a strain that is both resistant and fit. Furthermore, with continued therapy, viral evolution persists, creating species with greater numbers of mutations and higher level phenotypic resistance. Taken together, these facts suggest that continued use of NNRTIs after emergence of resistance will produce variants of complex mutational patterns that limit future treatment options, and, therefore, strong consideration should be given to discontinuing NNRTIs after virologic failure is confirmed. This article describes the scientific literature establishing the efficacy and limitations of NNRTI therapy and attempts to define a role for this class of drug in the long-term treatment of HIV-1 disease.},

@article{delahayeSequencingDNANanopores2021,
  abstract     = {Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ (ONT) long read sequencers offer access to longer DNA fragments than previous sequencer generations, at the cost of a higher error rate. While many papers have studied read correction methods, few have addressed the detailed characterization of observed errors, a task complicated by frequent changes in chemistry and software in ONT technology. The MinION sequencer is now more stable and this paper proposes an up-to-date view of its error landscape, using the most mature flowcell and basecaller. We studied Nanopore sequencing error biases on both bacterial and human DNA reads. We found that, although Nanopore sequencing is expected not to suffer from GC bias, it is a crucial parameter with respect to errors. In particular, low-GC reads have fewer errors than high-GC reads (about 6\% and 8\% respectively). The error profile for homopolymeric regions or regions with short repeats, the source of about half of all sequencing errors, also depends on the GC rate and mainly shows deletions, although there are some reads with long insertions. Another interesting finding is that the quality measure, although over-estimated, offers valuable information to predict the error rate as well as the abundance of reads. We supplemented this study with an analysis of a rapeseed RNA read set and shown a higher level of errors with a higher level of deletion in these data. Finally, we have implemented an open source pipeline for long-term monitoring of the error profile, which enables users to easily compute various analysis presented in this work, including for future developments of the sequencing device. Overall, we hope this work will provide a basis for the design of better error-correction methods.},

  abstract     = {(i) The following factors are held to be chiefly responsible for recent progress in the field of bacterial viruses: (a) the introduction of ‘one-step growth experiments’, (b) the concentration of attention on a small group of bacterial viruses, (c) the proof that virus-resistant mutants originate independently of the presence of virus, (d) the application of the electron microscope. (2) Types of virus morphology, as revealed by the electron microscope, are described. The virus particles of any one strain are of uniform size and shape. Many strains show a ‘head-and-tail’ structure. Sizes between 45 and 100 mμ have been found. (3) Classification of a group of seven viruses by serological cross reactions agrees perfectly with classification by morphology. (4) A method for determining the origin of mutations of bacteria from virus sensitivity to virus resistance is outlined. There is evidence that the classification of viruses by cross-resistance tests is of little value in establishing natural relationships between viruses. (5) The phenomenon of ‘lysogenesis’ is discussed, and certain ambiguities in its definition are pointed out. (6) The physiological basis of resistance of a bacterial strain to the attack by a specific virus is discussed. Such resistance is generally coupled with failure on the part of the bacteria to fix the virus in question by adsorption. Evidence shedding a new light on the process of adsorption is reported. (7) Bacterial viruses can mutate in such a way that their host range is altered. These mutations occur during the multiplication of the virus in its host. (8) The technique and terminology of ‘one-step growth experiments’ are briefly described. (9) When a bacterium is attacked simultaneously by several virus particles of the same strain or of different strains the bacterium reacts as if it had been attacked by only one particle (mutual exclusion effect). A detailed study of this phenomenon has led to the assumption that the membrane of the bacterium becomes impermeable to other virus particles after one particle has entered the cell (penetration hypothesis). The excluded virus particles may affect the yield of virus of the successful type (depressor effect). (10) The adaptation of the technique of the ‘one-step growth experiment’ to biochemical studies of virus multiplication is described. (n) The controversies regarding the nature of bacterial viruses are briefly touched upon, particularly with reference to the evolutionary standing of these viruses. (12) It is pointed out that a thorough study of bacterial viruses may lead to a better understanding of all types of viruses.},

A new module permits the alignment of multiple DNA sequence fragments, which has proven valuable in the comparison of incomplete genome sequences. We also describe a method to align more distantly related genomes by detecting protein sequence homology. This extension to MUMmer aligns two genomes after translating the sequence in all six reading frames, extracts all matching protein sequences and then clusters together matches. This method has been applied to both incomplete and complete genome sequences in order to detect regions of conserved synteny, in which multiple proteins from one organism are found in the same order and orientation in another.

  abstract     = {Integration of retroviral DNA is an obligatory step of retrovirus replication because proviral DNA is the template for productive infection. Integrase, a retroviral enzyme, catalyses integration. The process of integration can be divided into two sequential reactions. The first one, named 3'-processing, corresponds to a specific endonucleolytic reaction which prepares the viral DNA extremities to be competent for the subsequent covalent insertion, named strand transfer, into the host cell genome by a trans-esterification reaction. Recently, a novel specific activity of the full length integrase was reported, in vitro, by our group for two retroviral integrases (HIV-1 and PFV-1). This activity of internal cleavage occurs at a specific palindromic sequence mimicking the LTR-LTR junction described into the 2-LTR circles which are peculiar viral DNA forms found during viral infection. Moreover, recent studies demonstrated the existence of a weak palindromic consensus found at the integration sites. Taken together, these data underline the propensity of retroviral integrases for binding symmetrical sequences and give perspectives for targeting specific sequences used for gene therapy.},

Using linear non-threshold model (LNT), possible risks from exposure to low dose ionizing radiation (below 100~mSv) are estimated by extrapolating from data obtained after exposure to higher doses of radiation. This model has been challenged by numerous observations, in which cells that were not directly traversed by the ionizing radiation exhibited responses similar to those of the directly irradiated cells. Therefore, it is nowadays accepted that the detrimental effects of ionizing radiation are not restricted only in the irradiated cells, but also to non-irradiated bystander or even distant cells manifesting various biological effects.},

The amino acid sequence divergence may be held responsible for the differential sensitivity of HIV-1 RT and HIV-2 RT to the TIBO derivatives. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have introduced several amino acid substitutions in the conserved regions of HIV-1 RT. Where applicable, the amino acids were replaced by the corresponding amino acids present in HIV-2 RT. The amino acid residues Y181 and Y188 appeared to be critical for the anti-HIV-1 RT activity of the TIBO derivatives, since substitution of these residues by the corresponding HIV-2 amino acids I181 and L188 resulted in a virtual loss of TIBO sensitivity without loss of enzymatic activity.},

A third test, a paired-differencesttest based on 10-fold cross-validation, exhibits somewhat elevated probability of type I error. A fourth test, McNemar's test, is shown to have low type I error. The fifth test is a new test, 5 × 2 cv, based on five iterations of twofold cross-validation. Experiments show that this test also has acceptable type I error. The article also measures the power (ability to detect algorithm differences when they do exist) of these tests. The cross-validatedttest is the most powerful. The 5×2 cv test is shown to be slightly more powerful than McNemar's test. The choice of the best test is determined by the computational cost of running the learning algorithm. For algorithms that can be executed only once, Mc-Nemar's test is the only test with acceptable type I error. For algorithms that can be executed 10 times, the 5 × 2 cv test is recommended, because it is slightly more powerful and because it directly measures variation due to the choice of training set.},

  abstract  = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for unsupervised dimension reduction. K-means clustering is a commonly used data clustering for performing unsupervised learning tasks. Here we prove that principal components are the continuous solutions to the discrete cluster membership indicators for K-means clustering. New lower bounds for K-means objective function are derived, which is the total variance minus the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. These results indicate that unsupervised dimension reduction is closely related to unsupervised learning. Several implications are discussed. On dimension reduction, the result provides new insights to the observed effectiveness of PCA-based data reductions, beyond the conventional noise-reduction explanation that PCA, via singular value decomposition, provides the best low-dimensional linear approximation of the data. On learning, the result suggests effective techniques for K-means data clustering. DNA gene expression and Internet newsgroups are analyzed to illustrate our results. Experiments indicate that the new bounds are within 0.5-1.5\% of the optimal values.},

However, these reads display high error rates, and correction steps are necessary to realize their great potential in genomics and transcriptomics. Here, we compare properties of PacBio and Nanopore data and assess correction methods by Canu, MARVEL and proovread in various combinations. We found total error rates of around 13\% in the raw datasets. PacBio reads showed a high rate of insertions (around 8\%) whereas Nanopore reads showed similar rates for substitutions, insertions and deletions of around 4\% each. In data from both technologies the errors were uniformly distributed along reads apart from noisy 5′ ends, and homopolymers appeared among the most over-represented kmers relative to a reference. Consensus correction using read overlaps reduced error rates to about 1\% when using Canu or MARVEL after patching. The lowest error rate in Nanopore data (0.45\%) was achieved by applying proovread on MARVEL-patched data including Illumina short-reads, and the lowest error rate in PacBio data (0.42\%) was the result of Canu correction with minimap2 alignment after patching. Our study provides valuable insights and benchmarks regarding long-read data and correction methods.},

They are associated with important diseases such as human influenza, newly emerging haemorrhagic fevers or several forms of hepatitis. Virus particles are disparate in size, shape and composition, and enclose an RNA genome that can be either single stranded, double stranded, nonsegmented or segmented. Application of deep sequencing methodologies has unveiled their great abundance and ubiquity. The structural diversity of viral RNA is reflected in differences in their replication cycles that are completed through complex interactions between viral and host proteins. RNA viruses share error-prone replication that confers on them the capacity to adapt to a wide range of environments.

  abstract   = {Viruses are transmissible deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) genetic elements that require a cell for multiplication. Viruses are extremely diverse and ubiquitous in nature. They evolve in continuous interaction with their host cells and organisms, following the general Darwinian principles: genetic variation, competition among variant forms and selection of the most fit variants in a given environment. Viruses probably had an ancient origin and have survived as agents of gene transfer and promoters of cell variation. Evolution of RNA viruses and some DNA viruses can be extremely rapid, fuelled by limited template-copying fidelity of the replicating polymerases. They form extremely complex mutant clouds termed viral quasispecies, which can acquire features not explainable from the individuals that compose the ensemble. Quasispecies dynamics not only represent a problem for disease prevention and control, but it has inspired new strategies to combat viral disease. One of them is lethal mutagenesis or viral extinction driven by an excess of mutations, often produced by mutagenic nucleotide analogues. New antiviral designs based on lethal mutagenesis are currently under investigation. Key Concepts: Virions are the virus particles produced on completion of the intracellular replication cycle. Interhost transmission of virions can give rise to disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics. Metagenomic studies using deep sequencing methods have unveiled great diversity of viruses in many natural habitats. The ensemble of viruses in our biosphere is termed the ‘virosphere’. Evidence from comparative genomics suggests a long coevolution of cells and viruses on Earth. Recombination and horizontal gene transfers between viral and cellular genes have been abundant during evolution of life. Some proteins that play physiological functions in cells can be recruited as part of the innate immunity against viruses. Population bottlenecks may alter viral fitness and influence evolutionary outcomes. The adaptive potential of viral quasispecies has encouraged research in new strategies for viral disease prevention and control.},

  abstract     = {The evolutionary selection forces acting on a protein are commonly inferred using evolutionary codon models by contrasting the rate of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions. Most widely used models are based on theoretical assumptions and ignore the empirical observation that distinct amino acids differ in their replacement rates. In this paper, we develop a general method that allows assimilation of empirical amino acid replacement probabilities into a codon-substitution matrix. In this way, the resulting codon model takes into account not only the transition–transversion bias and the nonsynonymous/synonymous ratio, but also the different amino acid replacement probabilities as specified in empirical amino acid matrices. Different empirical amino acid replacement matrices, such as secondary structure–specific matrices or organelle-specific matrices (e.g., mitochondria and chloroplasts), can be incorporated into the model, making it context dependent. Using a diverse set of coding DNA sequences, we show that the novel model better fits biological data as compared with either mechanistic or empirical codon models. Using the suggested model, we further analyze human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease sequences obtained from drug-treated patients and reveal positive selection in sites that are known to confer drug resistance to the virus.},

  abstract     = {Motivation: Drug resistance is a very important factor influencing the failure of current HIV therapies.  The ability to predict the drug resistance of HIV protease mutants may be useful in developing more effective and longer lasting treatment regimens.Methods: The HIV resistance is predicted to two current protease inhibitors, Indinavir and Saquinavir. The problem was approached from two perspectives. First, a predictor was constructed based on the structural features of the HIV protease\textendash drug inhibitor complex. A particular structure was represented by its list of contacts between the inhibitor and the protease. Next, a classifier was constructed based on the sequence data of various drug resistant mutants. In both cases, self-organizing maps were first used to extract the important features and cluster the patterns in an unsupervised manner. This was followed by subsequent labelling based on the known patterns in the training set.Results: The prediction performance of the classifiers was measured by cross-validation. The classifier using the structure information correctly classified previously unseen mutants with an accuracy of between 60 and 70\%. Several architectures were tested on the more abundant sequence data. The best single classifier provided an accuracy of 68\% and a coverage of 69\%. Multiple networks were then combined into various majority voting schemes. The best combination yielded an average of 85\% coverage and 78\% accuracy on previously unseen data. This is more than two times better than the 33\% accuracy expected from a random classifier.Contact: sod@cs.wayne.edu*To whom correspondence should be addressed.},

Typically, sources of TDR remain unknown, but they can be characterized with molecular epidemiologic approaches. We used the highly representative Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and linked drug resistance database (SHCS-DRDB) to analyze sources of TDR.Methods.{$\quad$}ART-naive men who have sex with men with infection date estimates between 1996 and 2009 were chosen for surveillance of TDR in HIV-1 subtype B (N = 1674), as the SHCS-DRDB contains pre-ART genotypic resistance tests for \&gt;69\% of this surveillance population. A phylogeny was inferred using pol sequences from surveillance patients and all subtype B sequences from the SHCS-DRDB (6934 additional patients). Potential sources of TDR were identified based on phylogenetic clustering, shared resistance mutations, genetic distance, and estimated infection dates.Results.{$\quad$}One hundred forty of 1674 (8.4\%) surveillance patients carried virus with TDR; 86 of 140 (61.4\%) were assigned to clusters. Potential sources of TDR were found for 50 of 86 (58.1\%) of these patients. ART-naive patients constitute 56 of 66 (84.8\%) potential sources and were significantly overrepresented among sources (odds ratio, 6.43 [95\% confidence interval, 3.22–12.82]; P \&lt; .001). Particularly large transmission clusters were observed for the L90M mutation, and the spread of L90M continued even after the near cessation of antiretroviral use selecting for that mutation. Three clusters showed evidence of reversion of K103N or T215Y/F.Conclusions.{$\quad$}Many individuals harboring viral TDR belonged to transmission clusters with other Swiss patients, indicating substantial domestic transmission of TDR in Switzerland. Most TDR in clusters could be linked to sources, indicating good surveillance of TDR in the SHCS-DRDB. Most TDR sources were ART naive. This, and the presence of long TDR transmission chains, suggests that resistance mutations are frequently transmitted among untreated individuals, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.},

  abstract     = {Summary Background Growing evidence has linked HIV-1 resistance mutations and drug failure. The use of genotypic-resistance analysis to assist therapeutic decision-making in patients failing therapy has not been investigated. We assessed the virological and immunological impact of genotypic-resistance testing. Methods We did a prospective, open, randomised, controlled study of HIV-1-infected patients in whom combination therapy was not successful. We randomly assigned patients standard care (control, n=43) or treatment according to the resistance mutations in protease and reverse-transcriptase genes (genotypic group, n=65). The major endpoint was the change in HIV-1 RNA viral load. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings 108 patients were enrolled. All patients were similar for risk factors, age, sex, previous treatment, CD4-cell count (214/fxL [SD14]) and log HIV-1 RNA viral load at baseline (4–7 copies/ml [0–1]). At month 3, the mean change in HIV-1 RNA was -1-04 log (0–14) in the study group compared with −0–46 log (0–17) in the control group (mean difference 0–58 log [95\% Cl 0-14-1-02], p=0–01). At month 6, changes were −1–15 (0–15) log copies/mL, and −0-67 (0–19) log copies/mL in the genotypic group and the control group, respectively (mean difference 0–48 log [0-01-0-97], p=0-05). Difference in the drop in viral load combined at 3 months and 6 months was significant (p=0-015). At month 3, HIV-1 RNA was lower than detection level (200 copies/mL) in 29\% (19/65) of patients in the genotypic group versus 14\% (6/43) in the control group (p=0-017). At month 6, the values were 32\% (21/65) and 14\% (6/43) (p=0-067) for the genotypic group and the control group, respectively. Therapy was generally well tolerated, with ten patients (six in the genotypic group, four in the control group) requiring toxic-effect-related drug modification. Interpretation We found genotypic-resistance testing to have a significant benefit on the virological response when choosing a therapeutic alternative. Further study of the use of genotypic-resistance testing in assisting clinical decision-making is warranted.},

Published assessments and benchmark data sets for protein and, to a lesser extent, global nucleotide MSAs are available, but less effort has been made to establish benchmarks in the more general problem of whole-genome alignment (WGA). Using the same model as the successful Assemblathon competitions, we organized a competitive evaluation in which teams submitted their alignments and then assessments were performed collectively after all the submissions were received. Three data sets were used: Two were simulated and based on primate and mammalian phylogenies, and one was comprised of 20 real fly genomes. In total, 35 submissions were assessed, submitted by 10 teams using 12 different alignment pipelines. We found agreement between independent simulation-based and statistical assessments, indicating that there are substantial accuracy differences between contemporary alignment tools. We saw considerable differences in the alignment quality of differently annotated regions and found that few tools aligned the duplications analyzed. We found that many tools worked well at shorter evolutionary distances, but fewer performed competitively at longer distances. We provide all data sets, submissions, and assessment programs for further study and provide, as a resource for future benchmarking, a convenient repository of code and data for reproducing the simulation assessments.},

@article{eddyAcceleratedProfileHMM2011,
  abstract     = {Profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) and probabilistic inference methods have made important contributions to the theory of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the “multiple segment Viterbi” (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call “sparse rescaling”. These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.},

@article{edgarComparisonScoringFunctions2004,
  abstract     = {Motivation:In recent years, several methods have been proposed for aligning two protein sequence profiles, with reported improvements in alignment accuracy and homolog discrimination versus sequence–sequence methods (e.g. BLAST) and profile–sequence methods (e.g. PSI-BLAST). Profile–profile alignment is also the iterated step in progressive multiple sequence alignment algorithms such as CLUSTALW. However, little is known about the relative performance of different profile–profile scoring functions. In this work, we evaluate the alignment accuracy of 23 different profile–profile scoring functions by comparing alignments of 488 pairs of sequences with identity ≤30\% against structural alignments. We optimize parameters for all scoring functions on the same training set and use profiles of alignments from both PSI-BLAST and SAM-T99. Structural alignments are constructed from a consensus between the FSSP database and CE structural aligner. We compare the results with sequence–sequence and sequence–profile methods, including BLAST and PSI-BLAST.Results: We find that profile–profile alignment gives an average improvement over our test set of typically 2–3\% over profile–sequence alignment and ∼40\% over sequence–sequence alignment. No statistically significant difference is seen in the relative performance of most of the scoring functions tested. Significantly better results are obtained with profiles constructed from SAM-T99 alignments than from PSI-BLAST alignments.Availability: Source code, reference alignments and more detailed results are freely available at http://phylogenomics.berkeley.edu/profilealignment/},

They are often orders of magnitude faster than BLAST in practical applications, though sensitivity to distant protein relationships is lower. UCLUST is a new clustering method that exploits USEARCH to assign sequences to clusters. UCLUST offers several advantages over the widely used program CD-HIT, including higher speed, lower memory use, improved sensitivity, clustering at lower identities and classification of much larger datasets.Availability: Binaries are available at no charge for non-commercial use at http://www.drive5.com/usearchContact:robert@drive5.comSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{edgarSyncmersAreMore2021,
  abstract     = {Minimizers are widely used to select subsets of fixed-length substrings (k-mers) from biological sequences in applications ranging from read mapping to taxonomy prediction and indexing of large datasets. The minimizer of a string of w consecutive k-mers is the k-mer with smallest value according to an ordering of all k-mers. Syncmers are defined here as a family of alternative methods which select k-mers by inspecting the position of the smallest-valued substring of length s {$<$} k within the k-mer. For example, a closed syncmer is selected if its smallest s-mer is at the start or end of the k-mer. At least one closed syncmer must be found in every window of length (k − s) k-mers. Unlike a minimizer, a syncmer is identified by its sequence alone, and is therefore synchronized in the following sense: if a given k-mer is selected from one sequence, it will also be selected from any other sequence. Also, minimizers can be deleted by mutations in flanking sequence, which cannot happen with syncmers. Experiments on minimizers with parameters used in the minimap2 read mapper and Kraken taxonomy prediction algorithm respectively show that syncmers can simultaneously achieve both lower density and higher conservation compared to minimizers.},

  abstract     = {Nucleotide-competing reverse transcriptase inhibitors were shown to bind reversibly to the nucleotide-binding site of the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Here, we show that the presence of ATP can enhance the inhibitory effects of the prototype compound INDOPY-1. We employed a combination of cell-free and cell-based assays to shed light on the underlying molecular mechanism. Binding studies and site-specific footprinting experiments demonstrate the existence of a stable quaternary complex with HIV-1 RT, its nucleic acid substrate, INDOPY-1, and ATP. The complex is frozen in the post-translocational state that usually accommodates the incoming nucleotide substrate. Structure-activity relationship studies show that both the base and the phosphate moieties of ATP are elements that play important roles in enhancing the inhibitory effects of INDOPY-1. In vitro susceptibility measurements with mutant viruses containing amino acid substitutions K70G, V75T, L228R, and K219R in the putative ATP binding pocket revealed unexpectedly a hypersusceptible phenotype with respect to INDOPY-1. The same mutational cluster was previously shown to reduce susceptibility to the pyrophosphate analog phosphonoformic acid. However, in the absence of INDOPY-1, ATP can bind and act as a pyrophosphate donor under conditions that favor formation of the pre-translocated RT complex. We therefore conclude that the mutant enzyme facilitates simultaneous binding of INDOPY-1 and ATP to the post-translocated complex. Based on these data, we propose a model in which the bound ATP traps the inhibitor, which, in turn, compromises its dissociation.},

U\,=\,U signifies that individuals with HIV who receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) and have achieved and maintained an undetectable viral load cannot sexually transmit the virus to others. This concept, based on strong scientific evidence, has broad implications for treatment of HIV infection from a scientific and public health standpoint, for the self-esteem of individuals by reducing the stigma associated with HIV, and for certain legal aspects of HIV criminalization. In this Viewpoint, we examine the underlying science-based evidence supporting this important concept and the behavioral, social, and legal implications associated with the acceptance of the U = U concept.},

Here, we define an algorithmic approach, mdBG, that makes use of minimizer-space de Bruijn graphs to enable long-read genome assembly. mdBG achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in both speed and memory usage over existing methods without compromising accuracy. A human genome is assembled in under 10~min using 8 cores and 10 GB RAM, and 60 Gbp of metagenome reads are assembled in 4~min using 1 GB RAM. In addition, we constructed a minimizer-space de Bruijn graph-based representation of 661,405 bacterial genomes, comprising 16 million nodes and 45 million edges, and successfully search it for anti-microbial resistance (AMR) genes in 12~min. We expect our advances to be essential to sequence analysis, given the rise of long-read sequencing in genomics, metagenomics, and pangenomics.

@inproceedings{ekimRandomizedParallelAlgorithm2020,
  abstract  = {As the volume of next generation sequencing data increases, an urgent need for algorithms to efficiently process the data arises. Universal hitting sets (UHS) were recently introduced as an alternative to the central idea of minimizers in sequence analysis with the hopes that they could more efficiently address common tasks such as computing hash functions for read overlap, sparse suffix arrays, and Bloom filters. A UHS is a set of k-mers that hit every sequence of length L, and can thus serve as indices to L-long sequences. Unfortunately, methods for computing small UHSs are not yet practical for real-world sequencing instances due to their serial and deterministic nature, which leads to long runtimes and high memory demands when handling typical values of k (e.g. \$\$k {$>$} 13\$\$). To address this bottleneck, we present two algorithmic innovations to significantly decrease runtime while keeping memory usage low: (i) we leverage advanced theoretical and architectural techniques to parallelize and decrease memory usage in calculating k-mer hitting numbers; and (ii) we build upon techniques from randomized Set Cover to select universal k-mers much faster. We implemented these innovations in PASHA, the first randomized parallel algorithm for generating near-optimal UHSs, which newly handles \$\$k {$>$} 13\$\$. We demonstrate empirically that PASHA produces sets only slightly larger than those of serial deterministic algorithms; moreover, the set size is provably guaranteed to be within a small constant factor of the optimal size. PASHA’s runtime and memory-usage improvements are orders of magnitude faster than the current best algorithms. We expect our newly-practical construction of UHSs to be adopted in many high-throughput sequence analysis pipelines.},

The investigation concentrates on the structure of students' abilities to carry out conversions of functions from one mode of representation to others. Data were obtained from 587 students in grades 9 and 11. Using Confirmatory Factor Analysis, a model, that provides information about the significant role of the initial representations of conversions in students' processes, is developed and validated. Using the hierarchical clustering and implicative analysis, evidence is provided to students' compartmentalized thinking among representations. These findings remain stable across grades. The outcomes of the three methods were found to coincide and to complement each other.},

  abstract      = {Computational biology and bioinformatics provide vast data gold-mines from protein sequences, ideal for Language Models taken from NLP. These LMs reach for new prediction frontiers at low inference costs. Here, we trained two auto-regressive models (Transformer-XL, XLNet) and four auto-encoder models (BERT, Albert, Electra, T5) on data from UniRef and BFD containing up to 393 billion amino acids. The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer using 5616 GPUs and TPU Pod up-to 1024 cores. Dimensionality reduction revealed that the raw protein LM-embeddings from unlabeled data captured some biophysical features of protein sequences. We validated the advantage of using the embeddings as exclusive input for several subsequent tasks. The first was a per-residue prediction of protein secondary structure (3-state accuracy Q3=81\%-87\%); the second were per-protein predictions of protein sub-cellular localization (ten-state accuracy: Q10=81\%) and membrane vs. water-soluble (2-state accuracy Q2=91\%). For the per-residue predictions the transfer of the most informative embeddings (ProtT5) for the first time outperformed the state-of-the-art without using evolutionary information thereby bypassing expensive database searches. Taken together, the results implied that protein LMs learned some of the grammar of the language of life.

These methods are all classed under the name polytomous logistic regression (PLR). Models for PLR will be presented and compared; model parameters will be tested and estimated by weighted least squares and by likelihood. Usually, software is needed for computation, and available statistical software is reported. An industrial problem is solved to some extent as an example to illustrate the use of PLR. The paper is concluded by a discussion on the various PLR-methods and some topics that need a further study are mentioned.},

  abstract      = {Attention-based models trained on protein sequences have demonstrated incredible success at classification and generation tasks relevant for artificial intelligence-driven protein design. However, we lack a sufficient understanding of how very large-scale models and data play a role in effective protein model development. We introduce a suite of protein language models, named ProGen2, that are scaled up to 6.4B parameters and trained on different sequence datasets drawn from over a billion proteins from genomic, metagenomic, and immune repertoire databases. ProGen2 models show state-of-the-art performance in capturing the distribution of observed evolutionary sequences, generating novel viable sequences, and predicting protein fitness without additional finetuning. As large model sizes and raw numbers of protein sequences continue to become more widely accessible, our results suggest that a growing emphasis needs to be placed on the data distribution provided to a protein sequence model. We release the ProGen2 models and code at https://github.com/salesforce/progen.},

  abstract     = {The viral reverse transcriptase (RT) provides an attractive target in the search for anti-HIV therapies. The nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) are a diverse set of compounds (usually HIV-1 specific) that function by distorting the polymerase active site upon binding in a nearby pocket. Despite being potent and of generally low toxicity, their clinical use has been limited by rapid selection for resistant viral populations. The 2.65-A resolution structure of the complex between HIV-1 RT and the bis(heteroaryl)piperazine (BHAP) NNI, 1-(5-methanesulfonamido-1H-indol-2-yl-carbonyl)-4- [3-(1-methyl-ethylamino) pyridinyl] piperazine (U-90152), reveals the inhibitor conformation and bound water molecules. The bulky U-90152 molecule occupies the same pocket as other NNIs, but the complex is stabilized quite differently, in particular by hydrogen bonding to the main chain of Lys-103 and extensive hydrophobic contacts with Pro-236. These interactions rationalize observed resistance mutations, notably Pro-236-Leu, which occurs characteristically for BHAPs. When bound, part of U-90152 protrudes into the solvent creating a channel between Pro-236 and the polypeptide segments 225-226 and 105-106, giving the first clear evidence of the entry mode for NNIs. The structure allows prediction of binding modes for related inhibitors [(altrylamino)piperidine-BHAPs] and suggests changes to U-90152, such as the addition of a 6 amino group to the pyridine ring, which may make binding more resilient to mutations in the RT. The observation of novel hydrogen bonding to the protein main chain may provide lessons for the improvement of quite different inhibitors.},

  abstract  = {This chapter discusses various human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase structure and function. HIV integrase consists of three domains, the structures of that are individually determined by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The chapter discusses the domain structure of HIV-type 1 (HIV-1) Integrase. The core domain, spanning residues 50–212, is responsible for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The crystal structure of a dimer of this domain shows similarity to other proteins that carry out polynucleotidyl transfer, including MuA transposase and Ribonuclease H (RNase H). The small N-terminal domain folds into a dimeric helix-turn-helix structure, which is stabilized by the coordination of zinc with conserved histidine (His) and cysteine (Cys) residues. The chapter also discusses the catalytic core domain of the HIV integrase enzymes. In this reaction, a branched DNA substrate mimicking the product of DNA strand transfer is resolved into its viral DNA and target DNA parts. There is no evidence that disintegration is relevant in vivo, but it is a useful assay of the ability of integrase to carry out its basic function of catalyzing polynucleotidyl transfer. The chapter concludes with the multimeric organization of HIV Integrase and HIV Integrase–DNA Interactions.},

Currently, most regimens are combinations of inhibitors of two viral enzymes—reverse transcriptase and protease. Nevertheless, several steps in the HIV replication cycle are potential targets for intervention. These steps can be divided into entry steps, in which viral envelope glycoproteins and their receptors are involved, and postentry steps, involving viral accessory gene products and the cellular proteins with which they interact. New treatment options target viral entry into the cell. These treatments include the HIV fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide, and new HIV coreceptor antagonists in advanced stages of clinical development or in different stages of preclinical development. Here, we review the development of new HIV entry inhibitors, their performance in clinical trials, and their possible role in anti-HIV therapy.},

Location and dating estimates were validated using the earliest HIV-1 archival sample, also from Kinshasa.

  abstract     = {SummaryA progressive alignment method is described that utilizes the Needleman and Wunsch pairwise alignment algorithm iteratively to achieve the multiple alignment of a set of protein sequences and to construct an evolutionary tree depicting their relationship. The sequences are assumed a priori to share a common ancestor, and the trees are constructed from difference matrices derived directly from the multiple alignment. The thrust of the method involves putting more trust in the comparison of recently diverged sequences than in those evolved in the distant past. In particular, this rule is followed: “once a gap, always a gap”. The method has been applied to three sets of protein sequences: 7 superoxide dismutases, 11 globins, and 9 tyrosine kinase-like sequences. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees for these sets of sequences were determined and compared with trees derived by conventional pairwise treatments. In several instances, the progressive method led to trees that appeared to be more in line with biological expectations than were trees obtained by more commonly used methods.},

  abstract   = {We address the issue of compressing and indexing data. We devise a data structure whose space occupancy is a function of the entropy of the underlying data set. We call the data structure opportunistic since its space occupancy is decreased when the input is compressible and this space reduction is achieved at no significant slowdown in the query performance. More precisely, its space occupancy is optimal in an information-content sense because text T[1,u] is stored using O(H/sub k/(T))+o(1) bits per input symbol in the worst case, where H/sub k/(T) is the kth order empirical entropy of T (the bound holds for any fixed k). Given an arbitrary string P[1,p], the opportunistic data structure allows to search for the occurrences of P in T in O(p+occlog/sup /spl epsiv//u) time (for any fixed /spl epsiv/{$>$}0). If data are uncompressible we achieve the best space bound currently known (Grossi and Vitter, 2000); on compressible data our solution improves the succinct suffix array of (Grossi and Vitter, 2000) and the classical suffix tree and suffix array data structures either in space or in query time or both. We also study our opportunistic data structure in a dynamic setting and devise a variant achieving effective search and update time bounds. Finally, we show how to plug our opportunistic data structure into the Glimpse tool (Manber and Wu, 1994). The result is an indexing tool which achieves sublinear space and sublinear query time complexity.},

  abstract     = {High accuracy (fidelity) of DNA replication is important for cells to preserve genetic identity and to prevent accumulation of deleterious mutations. The error rate during DNA replication is as low as 10−9 to 10−11 errors per base pair. How this low level is achieved is an issue of major interest. This review is concerned with the mechanisms underlying the fidelity of the chromosomal replication in the model system Escherichia coli by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (HE), with further emphasis on participation of the other, accessory DNA polymerases, of which E. coli contains four (Pols I, II, IV, and V). Detailed genetic analysis of mutation rates revealed that (i) Pol II has an important role as a back-up proofreader for Pol III, (ii) Pols IV and V do not normally contribute significantly to replication fidelity, but can readily do so under conditions of elevated expression, (iii) participation of Pols IV and V, in contrast to that of Pol II, is specific to the lagging strand, and (iv) Pol I also makes a lagging-strand specific fidelity contribution, limited however to the faithful filling of the Okazaki fragment gaps. The fidelity role of the Pol III τ subunit is also reviewed.},

Previously, HMMER has mainly been available only as a computationally intensive UNIX command-line tool, restricting its use. Recent advances in the software, HMMER3, have resulted in a 100-fold speed gain relative to previous versions. It is now feasible to make efficient profile hidden Markov model (profile HMM) searches via the web. A HMMER web server (http://hmmer.janelia.org) has been designed and implemented such that most protein database searches return within a few seconds. Methods are available for searching either a single protein sequence, multiple protein sequence alignment or profile HMM against a target sequence database, and for searching a protein sequence against Pfam. The web server is designed to cater to a range of different user expertise and accepts batch uploading of multiple queries at once. All search methods are also available as RESTful web services, thereby allowing them to be readily integrated as remotely executed tasks in locally scripted workflows. We have focused on minimizing search times and the ability to rapidly display tabular results, regardless of the number of matches found, developing graphical summaries of the search results to provide quick, intuitive appraisement of them.},

In this paper a graph matching based identification approach for the retrieval of diatoms from an image database is presented. The retrieval is based on the matching of labeled grid graphs carrying texture information of the underlying diatom. A grid graph is a regular, rectangular arrangement of nodes overlaid on an image. Each node of the graph is labeled with texture features describing a rectangular sub-region of the object. Properties of gray level co-occurrence matrices as well as of Gabor wavelets are used as texture features. The method has been evaluated on a diatom database holding images of 188 different diatoms belonging to 38 classes. For the identification of these diatoms recognition rates of more than 90 percent were obtained.},

@article{fletcherEnfuvirtideNewDrug2003,
  abstract     = {We have previously reported a new class of dendrimers with tryptophan (Trp) residues on the surface that show dual antiviral activities against HIV and enterovirus EV71. The prototype compound of this family is a derivative of pentaerythritol with 12 peripheral Trp groups and trivalent spacer arms. Here a novel series of dendrimers with divalent and tetravalent branched arms, instead of the trivalent ones present on the prototype, has been synthesized and its activity against HIV, EV71 and a panel of 16 different viruses and other pathogens has been determined. Convergent or divergent approaches have been used for the synthesis of these compounds. Our findings demonstrate that only compounds with tetravalent branched arms showed the same anti-HIV and anti-EV71 activity of the prototype (low micromolar) and even gain significant antiviral activity against new pathogens such as HSV-2, adenovirus-2, human corona virus and respiratory syncytial virus, being the first members of the Trp dendrimer family that showed activity against those viruses. As the prototype, these compounds also showed low-nanomolar activity against a representative EV71 clinical isolate. Experimental work carried on to determine the mode of action of the most potent IIa, containing tetravalent branched arms, demonstrated that it interacts with the viral envelopes of HIV, EV71 and HSV-2 and thus may prevent virus attachment to the host cell. These results support the interest of this new series of Trp dendrimers and qualify them as useful prototypes for the development of novel inhibitors of viral entry with broad antiviral spectrum. The utilization of bioactive peptides in the development of highly selective and potent pharmacological agents for the disruption of protein–protein interactions is appealing for drug discovery. It is known that HIV-1 entry into a host cell is through a fusion process that is mediated by the trimeric viral glycoprotein gp120/41, which is derived from gp160 through proteolytic processing. Peptides derived from the HIV gp41 C-terminus have proven to be potent in inhibiting the fusion process. These peptides bind tightly to the hydrophobic pocket on the gp-41 N-terminus, which was previously identified as a potential inhibitor binding site. In this study, we introduce modified 23-residue C-peptides, 3 and 4, bearing a sulfono-γ-AA residue substitution and hydrocarbon stapling, respectively, which were developed for HIV-1 gp-41 N-terminus binding. Intriguingly, both 3 and 4 were capable of inhibiting envelope-mediated membrane fusion in cell–cell fusion assays at nanomolar potency. Our study reveals that sulfono-γ-AA modified peptides could be used for the development of more potent anti-HIV agents. We have recently described a new class of dendrimers with tryptophan (Trp) on the surface that show dual antiviral activities against HIV and EV71 enterovirus. The prototype compound of this family is a pentaerythritol derivative with 12 Trps on the periphery. Here we complete the structure-activity relationship studies of this family to identify key features that might be significant for the antiviral activity. With this aim, novel dendrimers containing different amino acids (aromatic and non-aromatic), tryptamine (a “decarboxylated” analogue of Trp) and N-methyl Trp on the periphery have been prepared. Dendrimer with N-Methyl Trp was the most active against HIV-1 and HIV-2 while dendrimer with tyrosine was endowed with the most potent antiviral activity against EV71. This tyrosine dendrimer proved to inhibit a large panel of EV71 clinical isolates (belonging to different clusters) in the low nanomolar/high picomolar range. In addition, a new synthetic procedure (convergent approach) has been developed for the synthesis of the prototype and some other dendrimers. This convergent approach proved more efficient (higher yields, easier purification) than the divergent approach previously reported. Dendrimers containing from 9 to 18 tryptophan residues at the peryphery have been efficiently synthesized and tested against HIV replication. These compounds inhibit an early step of the replicative cycle of HIV, presumably virus entry into its target cell. Our data suggest that HIV inhibition can be achieved by the preferred interaction of the compounds herein described with glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 of the HIV envelope preventing interaction between HIV and the (co)receptors present on the host cells. The results obtained so far indicate that 9 tryptophan residues on the periphery are sufficient for efficient gp120/gp41 binding and anti-HIV activity. Enfuvirtide (ENF) is currently the only FDA approved HIV fusion inhibitor in clinical use. Searching for more drugs in this category with higher efficacy and lower toxicity seems to be a logical next step. In line with this objective, a synthetic peptide with 36 amino acid residues, called Sifuvirtide (SFT), was designed based on the crystal structure of gp41. In this study, we show that SFT is a potent anti-HIV agent with relatively low cytotoxicity. SFT was found to inhibit replication of all tested HIV strains. The effective concentrations that inhibited 50\% viral replication (EC50), as determined in all tested strains, were either comparable or lower than benchmark values derived from well-known anti-HIV drugs like ENF or AZT, while the cytotoxic concentrations causing 50\% cell death (CC50) were relatively high, rendering it an ideal anti-HIV agent. A GST-pull down assay was performed to confirm that SFT is a fusion inhibitor. Furthermore, the activity of SFT on other targets in the HIV life cycle was also investigated, and all assays showed negative results. To further understand the mechanism of action of HIV peptide inhibitors, resistant variants of HIV-1IIIB were derived by serial virus passage in the presence of increasing doses of SFT or ENF. The results showed that there was cross-resistance between SFT and ENF. In conclusion, SFT is an ideal anti-HIV agent with high potency and low cytotoxicity, but may exhibit a certain extent of cross-resistance with ENF. The need for new classes of antiretroviral drugs has become apparent because of increasing concern about the long-term toxic effects of existing drugs, the need to combat HIV-1 variants that are resistant to treatment, and the frequency of treatment change in drug-experienced patients. Currently, most regimens are combinations of inhibitors of two viral enzymes—reverse transcriptase and protease. Nevertheless, several steps in the HIV replication cycle are potential targets for intervention. These steps can be divided into entry steps, in which viral envelope glycoproteins and their receptors are involved, and postentry steps, involving viral accessory gene products and the cellular proteins with which they interact. New treatment options target viral entry into the cell. These treatments include the HIV fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide, and new HIV coreceptor antagonists in advanced stages of clinical development or in different stages of preclinical development. Here, we review the development of new HIV entry inhibitors, their performance in clinical trials, and their possible role in anti-HIV therapy.},

@article{flynnDeepSequencingProtease2015,
  abstract     = {While the role of drug resistance mutations in HIV protease has been studied comprehensively, mutations in its substrate, Gag, have not been extensively cataloged. Using deep sequencing, we analyzed a unique collection of longitudinal viral samples from 93 patients who have been treated with therapies containing protease inhibitors (PIs). Due to the high sequence coverage within each sample, the frequencies of mutations at individual positions were calculated with high precision. We used this information to characterize the variability in the Gag polyprotein and its effects on PI-therapy outcomes. To examine covariation of mutations between two different sites using deep sequencing data, we developed an approach to estimate the tight bounds on the two-site bivariate probabilities in each viral sample, and the mutual information between pairs of positions based on all the bounds. Utilizing the new methodology we found that mutations in the matrix and p6 proteins contribute to continued therapy failure and have a major role in the network of strongly correlated mutations in the Gag polyprotein, as well as between Gag and protease. Although covariation is not direct evidence of structural propensities, we found the strongest correlations between residues on capsid and matrix of the same Gag protein were often due to structural proximity. This suggests that some of the strongest inter-protein Gag correlations are the result of structural proximity. Moreover, the strong covariation between residues in matrix and capsid at the N-terminus with p1 and p6 at the C-terminus is consistent with residue-residue contacts between these proteins at some point in the viral life cycle.},

  abstract     = {Assessing the reproducibility, accuracy and utility of massively parallel DNA sequencing platforms remains an ongoing challenge. Here the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF) Next-Generation Sequencing Study benchmarks the performance of a set of sequencing instruments (HiSeq/NovaSeq/paired-end 2\,×\,250-bp chemistry, Ion S5/Proton, PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS), Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION/MinION, BGISEQ-500/MGISEQ-2000 and GS111) on human and bacterial reference DNA samples. Among short-read instruments, HiSeq 4000 and X10 provided the most consistent, highest genome coverage, while BGI/MGISEQ provided the lowest sequencing error rates. The long-read instrument PacBio CCS had the highest reference-based mapping rate and lowest non-mapping rate. The two long-read platforms PacBio CCS and PromethION/MinION showed the best sequence mapping in repeat-rich areas and across homopolymers. NovaSeq 6000 using 2\,×\,250-bp read chemistry was the most robust instrument for capturing known insertion/deletion events. This study serves as a benchmark for current genomics technologies, as well as a resource to inform experimental design and next-generation sequencing variant calling.},

ART averted 9.5~million deaths worldwide in 1995–2015, with global economic benefits of \$1.05~trillion. For every \$1 spent on ART, \$3.50 in benefits accrued globally. If treatment scale-up achieves the global 90-90-90 targets of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, a total of 34.9~million deaths are projected to be averted between 1995 and 2030. Approximately 40.2~million new HIV infections could also be averted by ART, and economic gains could reach \$4.02~trillion in 2030. Having provided ART to 19.5~million people represents a major human achievement. However, 15.2~million infected people are currently not receiving treatment, which represents a significant lost opportunity. Further treatment scale-up could yield even greater health and economic benefits.},

Most viral proteins have no homologues in modern cells, in contradiction with the traditional view of viruses as pickpockets of cellular genes. This suggests that viral genes essentially originated in the virosphere during replication of viral genomes and/or were recruited from cellular lineages now extinct. Some specific viral proteins are present in viruses infecting members of the three domains of Life, suggesting that viruses are indeed very ancient. In particular, structural analyses of capsid proteins have revealed that at least two types of virions originated independently before the LUCA (the Last Universal Cellular Ancestor). Although several hypotheses have been recently proposed to explain the origin of viruses, the emergence of virions, as a specific mechanism for gene dissemination, remains unexplained.},

The three current hypotheses for virus origin, e.g. the virus first, the escape and the reduction hypotheses are revisited in this new framework. Theoretical considerations suggest that RNA viruses may have originated in the nucleoprotein world by escape or reduction from RNA-cells, whereas DNA viruses (at least some of them) might have evolved directly from RNA viruses. The antiquity of viruses can explain why most viral proteins have no cellular homologues or only distantly related ones. Viral proteins have replaced the ancestral bacterial RNA/DNA polymerases and primase during mitochondrial evolution. It has been suggested that replacement of cellular proteins by viral ones also occurred in early evolution of the DNA replication apparatus and/or that some DNA replication proteins originated directly in the virosphere and were later on transferred to cellular organisms. According to these new hypotheses, viruses played a critical role in major evolutionary transitions, such as the invention of DNA and DNA replication mechanisms, the formation of the three domains of life, or else, the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus.},

  abstract     = {{$<$}p{$>$}The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 p6 protein represents a docking site for several cellular and viral binding factors and fulfills major roles in the formation of infectious viruses. To date, however, the structure of this 52-amino acid protein, by far the smallest lentiviral protein known, either in its mature form as free p6 or as the C-terminal part of the Pr55 Gag polyprotein has not been unraveled. We have explored the high resolution structure and folding of p6 by CD and NMR spectroscopy. Under membranous solution conditions, p6 can adopt a helix-flexible helix structure; a short helix-1 (amino acids 14–18) is connected to a pronounced helix-2 (amino acids 33–44) by a flexible hinge region. Thus, p6 can be subdivided into two distinct structural and functional domains; helix-2 perfectly defines the region that binds to the virus budding factor AIP-1/ALIX, indicating that this structure is required for interaction with the endosomal sorting complex required for transport. The PTAP motif at the N terminus, comprising the primary late assembly domain, which is crucial for interaction with another cellular budding factor, Tsg101, does not exhibit secondary structure. However, the adjacent helix-1 may play an indirect role in the specific complex formation between p6 and the binding groove in Tsg101. Moreover, binding studies by NMR demonstrate that helix-2, which also comprises the L\emph{XX}LF motif required for incorporation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 accessory protein Vpr into budding virions, specifically interacts with the Vpr binding region, indicating that under the specific solution conditions used for structure analysis, p6 adopted a functional conformation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract  = {The idea of evidence accumulation for the combination of multiple clusterings was recently proposed [7]. Taking the K-means as the basic algorithm for the decomposition of data into a large number, k, of compact clusters, evidence on pattern association is accumulated, by a voting mechanism, over multiple clusterings obtained by random initializations of the K-means algorithm. This produces a mapping of the clusterings into a new similarity measure between patterns. The final data partition is obtained by applying the single-link method over this similarity matrix. In this paper we further explore and extend this idea, by proposing: (a) the combination of multiple K-means clusterings using variable k; (b) using cluster lifetime as the criterion for extracting the final clusters; and (c) the adaptation of this approach to string patterns. This leads to a more robust clustering technique, with fewer design parameters than the previous approach and potential applications in a wider range of problems.},

  abstract     = {Crystal structures have shown that the HIV-1 protease flaps, domains that control access to the active site, are closed when the active site is occupied by a ligand. Although flap structures ranging from closed to semi-open are observed in the free protease, crystal structures reveal that even the semi-open flaps block access to the active site, indicating that the flaps are mobile in solution. The goals of this paper are to characterize the secondary structure and fast (sub-ns) dynamics of the flaps of the free protease in solution, to relate these results to X-ray structures and to compare them with predictions of dynamics calculations. To this end we have obtained nearly complete backbone and many sidechain signal assignments of a fully active free-protease construct that is stabilized against autoproteolysis by three point mutations. The secondary structure of this protein was characterized using the chemical shift index, measurements of 3hJNC` couplings across hydrogen bonds, and NOESY connectivities. Analysis of these measurements indicates that the protease secondary structure becomes irregular near the flap tips, residues 49–53. Model-free analysis of 15N relaxation parameters, T1, T2 (T1ρ) and 15N-\{1H\} NOE, shows that residues in the flap tips are flexible on the sub-ns time scale, in contrast with previous observations on the inhibitor-bound protease. These results are compared with theoretical predictions of flap dynamics and the possible biological significance of the sub-ns time scale dynamics of the flap tips is discussed.},

  abstract     = {A substantial number of studies have been performed across the world to determine transmitted drug resistance. Large variations between different parts of the world can be expected because of differences in availability over time of treatment. Time trend analyses are often not possible because of small numbers of included patients. In this review, we present the available data on the transmission of drug-resistant HIV, with a major emphasis on the time trends of drug resistance prevalences. We identified relevant literature by searching in PubMed through September 2009. Studies were grouped, according to the year of data collection, into the following time periods: {$<$} 2001, 2001-2003, {$>$} 2003. We selected a total of 215 studies, which included 43,170 patients. The following prevalences of transmission of drug-resistant HIV were found, in rank order: North America (12.9\%), Europe (10.9\%), Latin America (6.3\%), Africa (4.7\%), and Asia (4.2\%). Changes over time in particular drugs classes were found in all parts of the world. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance declined over time in North America (p = 0.03), Europe (p {$<$} 0.001), and Latin America (p {$<$} 0.001). The decline in nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance reflects the improvement of treatment regimens in resource-rich settings. In contrast the resistance prevalence increased in Asia (p = 0.047) and Africa (p {$<$} 0.001). This can be explained by the antiretrovirals becoming more available during recent years in these continents. Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance rose over time in North America (p {$<$} 0.001), Europe (p {$<$} 0.001), Latin America (p {$<$} 0.001), and Asia (p = 0.01). This paper gives a complete overview of the epidemiology of resistance of antiretroviral drugs in drug-naive patients worldwide. The time trends that were observed seem to reflect changes in describing prescriptions over time. Changes include the more wide-spread use of antiretroviral drugs in developing countries and the development of therapies from low-active mono-therapies to highly active antiretroviral regimens in the industrialized countries.},

  abstract     = {Summary: CD-HIT is a widely used program for clustering biological sequences to reduce sequence redundancy and improve the performance of other sequence analyses. In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to ∼24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to ∼8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.Availability:http://cd-hit.org.Contact:liwz@sdsc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract     = {The genetic architecture of common traits, including the number, frequency, and effect sizes of inherited variants that contribute to individual risk, has been long debated. Genome-wide association studies have identified scores of common variants associated with type 2 diabetes, but in aggregate, these explain only a fraction of the heritability of this disease. Here, to test the hypothesis that lower-frequency variants explain much of the remainder, the GoT2D and T2D-GENES consortia performed whole-genome sequencing in 2,657 European individuals with and without diabetes, and exome sequencing in 12,940 individuals from five ancestry groups. To increase statistical power, we expanded the sample size via genotyping and imputation in a further 111,548 subjects. Variants associated with type 2 diabetes after sequencing were overwhelmingly common and most fell within regions previously identified by genome-wide association studies. Comprehensive enumeration of sequence variation is necessary to identify functional alleles that provide important clues to disease pathophysiology, but large-scale sequencing does not support the idea that lower-frequency variants have a major role in predisposition to type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract     = {Background DNA repair is a cellular defence mechanism responding to DNA damage caused in large part by oxidative stress. There is a controversy with regard to the effect of red blood cells on DNA damage and cellular response. Aim To investigate the effect of red blood cells on H2O2-induced DNA damage and repair in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Methods DNA breaks were induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by H2O2 in the absence or presence of red blood cells, red blood cells hemolysate or hemoglobin. DNA repair was measured by 3H-thymidine uptake, \% double-stranded DNA was measured by fluorometric assay of DNA unwinding. DNA damage was measured by the comet assay and by the detection of histone H2AX phosphorylation. Results Red blood cells and red blood cells hemolysate reduced DNA repair in a dose-dependent manner. Red blood cells hemolysate reduced \% double-stranded DNA, DNA damage and phosphorylation of histone H2AX. Hemoglobin had the same effect as red blood cells hemolysate on \% double-stranded DNA. Conclusion Red blood cells, via red blood cells hemolysate and hemoglobin, reduced the effect of oxidative stress on peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA damage and phosphorylation of histone H2AX. Consequently, recruitment of DNA repair proteins diminished with reduction of DNA repair. This suggests that anemia predisposes to increased oxidative stress induced DNA damage, while a higher hemoglobin level provides protection against oxidative-stress-induced DNA damage.},

Despite the fact that the Sputnik virophages were isolated with viruses belonging to group A of the Mimiviridae, they can grow in amoebae infected by Mimiviridae from groups A, B or C. In this study we describe Zamilon, the first virophage isolated with a member of group C of the Mimiviridae family. By co-culturing amoebae with purified Zamilon, we found that the virophage is able to multiply with members of groups B and C of the Mimiviridae family but not with viruses from group A. Zamilon has a 17,276 bp DNA genome that potentially encodes 20 genes. Most of these genes are closely related to genes from the Sputnik virophage, yet two are more related to Megavirus chiliensis genes, a group B Mimiviridae, and one to Moumouvirus monve transpoviron.},

Analysis of pol, env and long terminal repeat regions revealed the presence of three highly divergent HIV-2 strains, one of which (from one of the healthy subjects) was significantly more closely related to simian immunodeficiency viruses infecting sooty mangabeys and rhesus macaques (SIVSM/SIVMAC) than to any virus of human derivation. This subject also harboured multiply defective viral genotypes that resulted from hypermutation of G to A bases.

  abstract     = {From evolutionary interference, function annotation to structural prediction, protein sequence comparison has provided crucial biological insights. While many sequence alignment algorithms have been developed, existing approaches often cannot detect hidden structural relationships in the ‘twilight zone’ of low sequence identity. To address this critical problem, we introduce a computational algorithm that performs protein Sequence Alignments from deep-Learning of Structural Alignments (SAdLSA, silent ‘d’). The key idea is to implicitly learn the protein folding code from many thousands of structural alignments using experimentally determined protein structures.To demonstrate that the folding code was learned, we first show that SAdLSA trained on pure α-helical proteins successfully recognizes pairs of structurally related pure β-sheet protein domains. Subsequent training and benchmarking on larger, highly challenging datasets show significant improvement over established approaches. For challenging cases, SAdLSA is ∼150\% better than HHsearch for generating pairwise alignments and ∼50\% better for identifying the proteins with the best alignments in a sequence library. The time complexity of SAdLSA is O(N) thanks to GPU acceleration.Datasets and source codes of SAdLSA are available free of charge for academic users at http://sites.gatech.edu/cssb/sadlsa/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract     = {The human AIDS viruses human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) represent cross-species (zoonotic) infections1,2,3,4. Although the primate reservoir of HIV-2 has been clearly identified as the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys)2,4,5,6,7, the origin of HIV-1 remains uncertain. Viruses related to HIV-1 have been isolated from the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes)8,9, but only three such SIVcpz infections have been documented1,10,11, one of which involved a virus so divergent11 that it might represent a different primate lentiviral lineage. In a search for the HIV-1 reservoir, we have now sequenced the genome of a new SIVcpz strain (SIVcpzUS) and have determined, by mitochondrial DNA analysis, the subspecies identity of all known SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees. We find that two chimpanzee subspecies in Africa, the central P. t. troglodytes  and the eastern P. t. schweinfurthii, harbour SIVcpz and that their respective viruses form two highly divergent (but subspecies-specific) phylogenetic lineages. All HIV-1 strains known to infect man, including HIV-1 groups M, N and O, are closely related to just one of these SIVcpz lineages, that found in P. t. troglodytes. Moreover, we find that HIV-1 group N is a mosaic of SIVcpzUS- and HIV-1-related sequences, indicating an ancestral recombination event in a chimpanzee host. These results, together with the observation that the natural range of P. t. troglodytes coincides uniquely with areas of HIV-1 group M, N and O endemicity, indicate that P. t. troglodytes  is the primary reservoir for HIV-1 and has been the source of at least three independent introductions of SIVcpz into the human population.},

  abstract     = {Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are used for structural1,2 and evolutionary predictions1,2, but the complexity of aligning large datasets requires the use of approximate solutions3, including the progressive algorithm4. Progressive MSA methods start by aligning the most similar sequences and subsequently incorporate the remaining sequences, from leaf to root, based on a guide tree. Their accuracy declines substantially as the number of sequences is scaled up5. We introduce a regressive algorithm that enables MSA of up to 1.4 million sequences on a standard workstation and substantially improves accuracy on datasets larger than 10,000 sequences. Our regressive algorithm works the other way around from the progressive algorithm and begins by aligning the most dissimilar sequences. It uses an efficient divide-and-conquer strategy to run third-party alignment methods in linear time, regardless of their original complexity. Our approach will enable analyses of extremely large genomic datasets such as the recently announced Earth BioGenome Project, which comprises 1.5 million eukaryotic genomes6.},

  abstract     = {Fostemsavir is a prodrug of a first-in-class HIV-1 attachment inhibitor, temsavir, that binds to gp120 and blocks attachment to the host-cell CD4 receptor, preventing entry and infection of the target cell. Previous studies using a limited number of clinical isolates showed that there was intrinsic variability in their susceptibility to temsavir.Here, an analysis was performed using all clinical isolates analysed in the Monogram Biosciences PhenoSense® Entry assay as part of the development programme.In total, 1337 individual envelopes encompassing 20 different HIV-1 subtypes were examined for their susceptibility to temsavir. However, only seven subtypes (B, C, F1, A, [B, F1], BF and A1) were present more than five times, with subtype B (881 isolates) and subtype C (156 isolates) having the largest numbers.As expected, variability in susceptibility was observed within all subtypes. However, for the great majority of these viruses, temsavir was highly potent, with most viruses exhibiting IC50s \&lt;10\,nM. One exception was CRF01\_AE viruses, where all five isolates exhibited IC50s \&gt;100\,nM. For the 607 isolates where tropism data were available, geometric mean temsavir IC50 values were remarkably similar for CCR5-, CXCR4- and dual mixed-tropic envelopes from infected individuals.These data show that HIV-1 viruses from most subtypes are highly susceptible to temsavir and that temsavir susceptibility is independent of tropism.},

@article{gascuelStochasticSafetyRadius2016,
  abstract     = {A variety of algorithms have been proposed for reconstructing trees that show the evolutionary relationships between species by comparing differences in genetic data across present-day species. If the leaf-to-leaf distances in a tree can be accurately estimated, then it is possible to reconstruct this tree from these estimated distances, using polynomial-time methods such as the popular ‘Neighbor-Joining’ algorithm. There is a precise combinatorial condition under which distance-based methods are guaranteed to return a correct tree (in full or in part) based on the requirement that the input distances all lie within some ‘safety radius’ of the true distances. Here, we explore a stochastic analogue of this condition, and mathematically establish upper and lower bounds on this ‘stochastic safety radius’ for distance-based tree reconstruction methods. Using simulations, we show how this notion provides a new way to compare the performance of distance-based tree reconstruction methods. This may help explain why Neighbor-Joining performs so well, as its stochastic safety radius appears close to optimal (while its more classical safety radius is the same as many other less accurate methods).},

Many practical applications relating to this field have been developed. New methods have appeared in recent years, due to developments concerning Neural Networks and Machine Learning. These "hybrid" approaches share one common factor in that they combine symbolic and numerical aspects. The former are characterized by the representation of knowledge, the latter by the introduction of frequencies and probabilistic criteria. In the present study, we shall present a certain number of hybrid methods, conceived (or improved) by members of the SYMENU research group. These methods issue mainly from Machine Learning and from research on Classification Trees done in Statistics, and they may also be qualified as "rule-based". They shall be compared with other more classical approaches. This comparison will be based on a detailed description of each of the twelve methods envisaged, and on the results obtained concerning the "Waveform Recognition Problem" proposed by Breiman et al.,4 which is difficult for rule based approaches.},

  abstract     = {Purpose of review~         This review highlights recent data on the pathways of resistance that impact the clinical activity of first-generation and second-generation integrase inhibitors.         Recent findings~         Raltegravir (RAL) and elvitegravir (EVG) are highly efficacious in first-line antiretroviral therapy, with small numbers of virological failures observed in clinical trials. Durable activity in treatment-experienced patients requires a fully supportive background regimen. RAL and EVG show a low-to-moderate genetic barrier to resistance and extensive cross-resistance, which preclude their sequential use. Resistance to dolutegravir (DTG) is not selected as readily in vitro and has not emerged in studies of treatment-naïve patients to date. Both in vitro and in vivo, DTG retains activity against several RAL and EVG resistant strains, but susceptibility is variably impaired by multiple mutations within the G148 pathway, which are common after RAL or EVG failure. Cross-resistance can be partially overcome by doubling DTG dosing to twice daily, but durability of responses remains dependent on a supportive background regimen. There is variability in the integrase gene of circulating HIV strains, which does not appear to reduce drug activity, although it may influence the emergence and evolution of integrase resistance. Transmission of integrase resistance remains rare but surveillance is required.         Summary~         Integrase inhibitors provide a potent option for the treatment of HIV infection. Drug resistance remains a challenge, which may be partially overcome by the introduction of second-generation compounds. Prompt management of RAL and EVG failure is required to prevent the accumulation of multiple resistance mutations that reduce DTG susceptibility.},

  abstract     = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An update is given on the epidemiology of transmitted antiretroviral drug resistance among HIV-1-infected adults. RECENT FINDINGS: Reported prevalence surveys show inter-region and intra-region variability, in part as a result of methodological differences. Temporal trends are difficult to define as rates appear stable or declining in some cohorts but increasing in others. While the highest prevalence continues to be observed in North America, Western Europe and areas of South America, transmitted antiretroviral drug resistance is emerging in countries where access to therapy is being scaled up, including regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Resistance patterns in drug-experienced and drug-naïve persons, transmission efficiency of resistant variants and their ability to persist as dominant species in the absence of drug pressure determine the prevalence of resistance mutations in persons with transmitted antiretroviral drug resistance. The most frequently detected mutations are in reverse transcriptase, especially thymidine analogue mutations, whereas protease mutations other than natural polymorphisms are generally less prevalent. SUMMARY: A consensus is required internationally on how transmitted antiretroviral drug resistance should be investigated and reported. Although routine testing methods provide only minimal estimates of the prevalence of transmitted antiretroviral drug resistance, successful treatment outcomes are observed in patients with resistance receiving first-line therapy guided by baseline resistance testing.},

  abstract     = {Clinical studies have demonstrated that use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with or without emtricitabine as antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can decrease the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition when medication adherence is high. However, the potential for PrEP to promote antiretroviral resistance remains an important public health consideration. We performed a search of the medical literature to identify studies that address HIV drug resistance during PrEP use. In this review, we summarize findings about emergent drug resistance during clinical trials of PrEP, case reports of seroconversions in patients adherent to PrEP, and animal studies of PrEP effectiveness against drug-resistant viral strains. We also discuss the potential utility of novel PrEP formulations for protection against drug-resistant HIV, the impact of drug resistance on HIV treatment options, and mathematical models that estimate the potential contribution of PrEP to population-level drug resistance. Evidence suggests that selection for HIV drug resistance with PrEP use is infrequent and most likely to occur when PrEP is used during undiagnosed acute HIV infection. Breakthrough infections during PrEP use with high adherence are possible, but appear to be rare. The prevalence of drug-resistant HIV strains needs to be monitored as PrEP is scaled up. However, the benefit of a decreased HIV incidence with wider PrEP use is likely to outweigh the risk of harms from possible increases in the prevalence of HIV drug resistance.},

  abstract     = {From a prospective cohort study of 1948 initially human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) uninfected female commercial sex workers followed between 1985 and 1999 in Dakar, Senegal, the authors compared the male to female per infectious sexual exposure transmission probability of HIV types one (HIV-1) and two (HIV-2). New non-parametric competing risks failure time methods were used, which minimized modelling assumptions and controlled for risk factors for HIV infection. The HIV-1 versus HIV-2 infectivity ratio over time was estimated by the ratio of smoothed non-parametric kernel estimates of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection hazard functions in sex workers, adjusted by an estimate of the relative HIV-1 versus HIV-2 prevalence in the partner population. HIV-1 was found to be significantly more infectious than HIV-2 throughout the follow-up period (P {$<$} 0.001). The HIV-1/HIV-2 infectivity ratio was inferred to be approximately constant over time, with estimated common value 3.55. The finding of greater HIV-1 infectivity persisted in sensitivity analyses and in covariate-adjusted analyses, with adjusted infectivity ratio estimates ranging between 3.40 and 3.86. Understanding the mechanisms by which HIV-1 infects more efficiently than HIV-2 may be useful in the development of HIV-1 vaccines. Additionally, the methodology developed here may be useful for analysing other data sets. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We used linear support vector machines as the classifier in the tests. We also analyzed our technique by comparing some feature encoding techniques. The tests are carried out on PR-1625 and PR-3261 datasets.

The learning models behind the software are described in two research papers. We found the description of the models in these papers to be somewhat cryptic and hard to follow. While the motivations and presentation may be obvious to the neural-networks language-modeling crowd, we had to struggle quite a bit to figure out the rationale behind the equations. This note is an attempt to explain equation (4) (negative sampling) in "Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality" by Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado and Jeffrey Dean.},

  abstract     = {Objective To characterize reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations by their association with extent of nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI) therapy. To identify mutational clusters in RT sequences from persons receiving multiple NRTI. Design A total of 1210 RT sequences from persons with known antiretroviral therapy were analyzed: 641 new sequences were performed at Stanford University Hospital; 569 were previously published. Methods Chi-square tests and logistic regression were done to identify associations between mutations and NRTI therapy. Correlation studies were done to identify mutational clusters. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Results Mutations at 26 positions were significantly associated with NRTI including 17 known resistance mutations (positions 41, 44, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 74, 75, 77, 116, 118, 151, 184, 210, 215, 219) and nine previously unreported mutations (positions 20, 39, 43, 203, 208, 218, 221, 223, 228). The nine new mutations correlated linearly with number of NRTI; 777 out of 817 (95\%) instances occurred with known drug resistance mutations. Positions 203, 208, 218, 221, 223, and 228 were conserved in untreated persons; positions 20, 39, and 43 were polymorphic. Most NRTI-associated mutations clustered into three groups: (i) 62, 65, 75, 77, 115, 116, 151; (ii) 41, 43, 44, 118, 208, 210, 215, 223; (iii) 67, 69, 70, 218, 219, 228. Conclusions Mutations at nine previously unreported positions are associated with NRTI therapy. These mutations are probably accessory because they occur almost exclusively with known drug resistance mutations. Most NRTI mutations group into one of three clusters, although several (e.g., M184V) occur in multiple mutational contexts.},

  abstract     = {There are two major paradigms in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology: short-read sequencing and long-read sequencing. Short-read sequencing approaches provide lower-cost, higher-accuracy data that are useful for population-level research and clinical variant discovery. By contrast, long-read approaches provide read lengths that are well suited for de novo genome assembly applications and full-length isoform sequencing.NGS technologies have been evolving over the past 10 years, leading to substantial improvements in quality and yield; however, certain approaches have proven to be more effective and adaptable than others.Recent improvements in chemistry, costs, throughput and accessibility are driving the emergence of new, varied technologies to address applications that were not previously possible. These include integrated long-read and short-read sequencing studies, routine clinical DNA sequencing, real-time pathogen DNA monitoring and massive population-level projects.Although massive strides are being made in this technology, several notable limitations remain. The time required to sequence and analyse data limits the use of NGS in clinical applications in which time is an important factor; the costs and error rates of long-read sequencing make it prohibitive for routine use, and ethical considerations can limit the public and private use of genetic data.We can expect increasing democratization and options for NGS in the future. Many new instruments with varied chemistries and applications are being released or being developed.},

Recently, a nanopore-based sequencing instrument, the Oxford Nanopore MinION, has become available, and we used this for sequencing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. To make use of these data, we developed a novel open-source hybrid error correction algorithm Nanocorr specifically for Oxford Nanopore reads, because existing packages were incapable of assembling the long read lengths (5–50 kbp) at such high error rates (between ∼5\% and 40\% error). With this new method, we were able to perform a hybrid error correction of the nanopore reads using complementary MiSeq data and produce a de novo assembly that is highly contiguous and accurate: The contig N50 length is more than ten times greater than an Illumina-only assembly (678 kb versus 59.9 kbp) and has {$>$}99.88\% consensus identity when compared to the reference. Furthermore, the assembly with the long nanopore reads presents a much more complete representation of the features of the genome and correctly assembles gene cassettes, rRNAs, transposable elements, and other genomic features that were almost entirely absent in the Illumina-only assembly.},

The substitution matrices in popular use today are usually constructed without consideration of the structural context in which the substitution takes place. Here, we present amino acid substitution matrices specific for particular polar–nonpolar environment of the amino acid. As expected, these matrices [context-specific substitution matrices (CSSMs)] show striking differences from the popular BLOSUM62 matrix, which does not include structural information. When incorporated into BLAST and PSI-BLAST, CSSM outperformed BLOSUM matrices as assessed by ROC curve analyses of the number of true and false hits and by the accuracy of the sequence alignments to the hit sequences. These findings are also of relevance to profile–profile-based methods of homology detection, since CSSMs may help build a better profile.

@article{goonesekereFrequencyGapsObserved2004,
  abstract     = {Gap penalty is an important component of the scoring scheme that is needed when searching for homologous proteins and for accurate alignment of protein sequences. Most homology search and sequence alignment algorithms employ a heuristic ‘affine gap penalty’ scheme q+r × n, in which q is the penalty for opening a gap, r the penalty for extending it and n the gap length. In order to devise a more rational scoring scheme, we examined the pattern of gaps that occur in a database of structurally aligned protein domain pairs. We find that the logarithm of the frequency of gaps varies linearly with the length of the gap, but with a break at a gap of length 3, and is well approximated by two linear regression lines with R2 values of 1.0 and 0.99. The bilinear behavior is retained when gaps are categorized by secondary structures of the two residues flanking the gap. Similar results were obtained when another, totally independent, structurally aligned protein pair database was used. These results suggest a modification of the affine gap penalty function.},

Our results demonstrate that transcription errors can occur in any gene, at any location, and affect every aspect of protein structure and function. In addition, we show that multiple proteins safeguard the fidelity of transcription and provide evidence suggesting that errors that evade these layers of RNA quality control profoundly affect the physiology of living cells. Together, these observations demonstrate that there is an inherent limit to the faithful expression of the genome and suggest that the impact of mutagenesis on cellular health and fitness is substantially greater than currently appreciated.},

An integrated system was developed that includes target gene amplification, DNA sequencing chemistry (TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit), and hardware and interpretative software (the OpenGene DNA Sequencing System) for detection of mutations in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease and reverse transcriptase sequences. The integrated system incorporates reverse transcription-PCR from extracted HIV-1 RNA, a coupled amplification and sequencing step (CLIP), polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, semiautomated analysis of data, and generation of an interpretative report. To assess the accuracy and robustness of the assay system, 270 coded plasma specimens derived from nine patients were sent to six laboratories for blinded analysis. All specimens contained HIV-1 subtype B viruses. Results of 270 independent assays were compared to “gold standard” consensus sequences of the virus populations determined by sequence analysis of 16 to 20 clones of viral DNA amplicons derived from two independent PCRs using primers not used in the kit. The accuracy of the integrated system for nucleotide base identification was 98.7\%, and the accuracy for codon identification at 54 sites associated with drug resistance was 97.6\%. In a separate analysis of plasma spiked with infectious molecular clones, the assay reproducibly detected all 72 different drug resistance mutations that were evaluated. There were no significant differences in accuracy between laboratories, between technologists, between kit lots, or between days. This integrated assay system for the detection of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations has a high degree of accuracy and reproducibility in several laboratories.},

@article{gregoryRegulationCellSurvival1994,
  abstract     = {Burkitt lymphoma (BL) tumour-cell populations are known to display high rates both of proliferation and of apoptosis in vivo, but the mechanisms which determine whether a BL cell continues to cycle or engages its cell-death programme are not understood. Group-I BL-derived cell lines, which retain in vitro the proliferative and apoptotic capacities of the parental cells, selectively entered apoptosis when returned to 37 degrees C after a brief period at low temperature (1 degree C). The induction of apoptosis by cold treatment, as determined by morphological characteristics and DNA fragmentation, was readily detectable within the first 1 to 2 hr of re-incubation at 37 degrees C, reaching a maximum at 4 to 6 hours. Commitment to enter apoptosis occurred after as little as 20 to 30 min at 1 degree C. Significant cell death at 1 degree C occurred only during prolonged incubation in the cold and displayed the characteristics of necrosis. Both bcl-2-dependent and -independent survival pathways were found to provide protection from cold-induced apoptosis, but only if engaged before cold-shock treatment. These results indicate that continued cycling of group-I BL cells is dependent upon their capacity to inhibit or circumvent their normally constitutively active apoptotic programme, and are consistent with the notion that the synthesis of one or more critical "survival" proteins of short half-life is necessary to guarantee successful passage through the cell cycle. Notably, high levels of apoptosis were also inducible in group-I BL cells by inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis.},

@article{guindonNewAlgorithmsMethods2010,
  abstract     = {PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early PhyML versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696–704), PhyML has been widely used (\&gt;2500 citations in ISI Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira–Hasegawa–like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The new protease inhibitors are potent inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs they may be able to cause profound and sustained suppression of HIV replication. METHODS: In this double-blind study, 97 HIV-infected patients who had received zidovudine treatment for at least 6 months and had 50 to 400 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter and at least 20,000 copies of HIV RNA per milliliter were randomly assigned to one of three treatments for up to 52 weeks: 800 mg of indinavir every eight hours; 200 mg of zidovudine every eight hours combined with 150 mg of lamivudine twice daily; or all three drugs. The patients were followed to monitor the occurrence of adverse events and changes in viral load and CD4 cell counts. RESULTS: The decrease in HIV RNA over the first 24 weeks was greater in the three-drug group than in the other groups (P{$<$}0.001 for each comparison). RNA levels decreased to less than 500 copies per milliliter at week 24 in 28 of 31 patients in the three-drug group (90 percent), 12 of 28 patients in the indinavir group (43 percent), and none of 30 patients in the zidovudine-lamivudine group. The increase in CD4 cell counts over the first 24 weeks was greater in the two groups receiving indinavir than in the zidovudine-lamivudine group (P{$<$} or =0.01 for each comparison). The changes in the viral load and the CD4 cell count persisted for up to 52 weeks. All the regimens were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In most HIV-infected patients with prior antiretroviral therapy, the combination of indinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine reduces levels of HIV RNA to less than 500 copies per milliliter for as long as one year.},

  abstract     = {Contemporary antiretroviral therapies (ART) and management strategies have diminished both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment failure and the acquired resistance to drugs in resource-rich regions, but transmission of drug-resistant viruses has not similarly decreased. In low- and middle-income regions, ART roll-out has improved outcomes, but has resulted in increasing acquired and transmitted resistances. Our objective was to review resistance to ART drugs and methods to detect it, and to provide updated recommendations for testing and monitoring for drug resistance in HIV-infected individuals.A volunteer panel of experts appointed by the International Antiviral (formerly AIDS) Society–USA reviewed relevant peer-reviewed data that were published or presented at scientific conferences. Recommendations were rated according to the strength of the recommendation and quality of the evidence, and reached by full panel consensus.Resistance testing remains a cornerstone of ART. It is recommended in newly-diagnosed individuals and in patients in whom ART has failed. Testing for transmitted integrase strand-transfer inhibitor resistance is currently not recommended, but this may change as more resistance emerges with widespread use. Sanger-based and next-generation sequencing approaches are each suited for genotypic testing. Testing for minority variants harboring drug resistance may only be considered if treatments depend on a first-generation nonnucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Different HIV-1 subtypes do not need special considerations regarding resistance testing.Testing for HIV drug resistance in drug-naive individuals and in patients in whom antiretroviral drugs are failing, and the appreciation of the role of testing, are crucial to the prevention and management of failure of ART.},

Position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) features are widely used in the structure property prediction. However, some proteins may have low-quality PSSM features due to insufficient homologous sequences, leading to limited prediction accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose an enhancing scheme for PSSM features. We introduce the “Bagging MSA” (multiple sequence alignment) method to calculate PSSM features used to train our model, adopt a convolutional network to capture local context features and bidirectional long short-term memory for long-term dependencies, and integrate them under an unsupervised framework. Structure property prediction models are then built upon such enhanced PSSM features for more accurate predictions. Moreover, we develop two frameworks to evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced PSSM features, which also bring proposed method into real-world scenarios. Empirical evaluation of CB513, CASP11, and CASP12 data sets indicates that our unsupervised enhancing scheme indeed generates more informative PSSM features for structure property prediction.},

  abstract     = {Background Pretreatment drug resistance in people initiating or re-initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) might compromise HIV control in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to assess the scale of this problem and whether it is associated with the intiation or re-initiation of ART in people who have had previous exposure to antiretroviral drugs. Methods This study was a systematic review and meta-regression analysis. We assessed regional prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance and risk of pretreatment drug resistance in people initiating ART who reported previous ART exposure. We systematically screened publications and unpublished datasets for pretreatment drug-resistance data in individuals in LMICs initiating or re-initiating first-line ART from LMICs. We searched for studies in PubMed and Embase and conference abstracts and presentations from the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, the International AIDS Society Conference, and the International Drug Resistance Workshop for the period Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2016. To assess the prevalence of drug resistance within a specified region at any specific timepoint, we extracted study level data and pooled prevalence estimates within the region using an empty logistic regression model with a random effect at the study level. We used random effects meta-regression to relate sampling year to prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance within geographical regions. Findings We identified 358 datasets that contributed data to our analyses, representing 56\hphantom{,}044 adults in 63 countries. Prevalence estimates of pretreatment NNRTI resistance in 2016 were 11·0\% (7·5–15·9) in southern Africa, 10·1\% (5·1–19·4) in eastern Africa, 7·2\% (2·9–16·5) in western and central Africa, and 9·4\% (6·6–13·2) in Latin America and the Caribbean. There were substantial increases in pretreatment NNRTI resistance per year in all regions. The yearly increases in the odds of pretreatment drug resistance were 23\% (95\% CI 16–29) in southern Africa, 17\% (5–30) in eastern Africa, 17\% (6–29) in western and central Africa, 11\% (5–18) in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 11\% (2–20) in Asia. Estimated increases in the absolute prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance between 2015 and 2016 ranged from 0·3\% in Asia to 1·8\% in southern Africa. Interpretation Pretreatment drug resistance is increasing at substantial rate in LMICs, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2016, the prevalence of pretreatment NNRTI resistance was near WHO's 10\% threshold for changing first-line ART in southern and eastern Africa and Latin America, underscoring the need for routine national HIV drug-resistance surveillance and review of national policies for first-line ART regimen composition.

@article{guSizeDistributionInsertions1995,
  abstract     = {The size distributions of deletions, insertions, and indels (i.e., insertions or deletions) were studied, using 78 human processed pseudogenes and other published data sets. The following results were obtained: (1) Deletions occur more frequently than do insertions in sequence evolution; none of the pseudogenes studied shows significantly more insertions than deletions. (2) Empirically, the size distributions of deletions, insertions, and indels can be described well by a power law, i.e., fk= Ck−b, where fkis the frequency of deletion, insertion, or indel with gap length k, b is the power parameter, and C is the normalization factor. (3) The estimates of b for deletions and insertions from the same data set are approximately equal to each other, indicating that the size distributions for deletions and insertions are approximately identical. (4) The variation in the estimates of b among various data sets is small, indicating that the effect of local structure exists but only plays a secondary role in the size distribution of deletions and insertions. (5) The linear gap penalty, which is most commonly used in sequence alignment, is not supported by our analysis; rather, the power law for the size distribution of indels suggests that an appropriate gap penalty is wk= a + b ln k, where a is the gap creation cost and blnk is the gap extension cost. (6) The higher frequency of deletion over insertion suggests that the gap creation cost of insertion (ai) should be larger than that of deletion (ad); that is, ai− ad= In R, where R is the frequency ratio of deletions to insertions.},

  abstract     = {Motivation : Today, the base code of DNA is mostly determined through sequencing by synthesis as provided by the Illumina sequencers. Although highly accurate, resulting reads are short, making their analyses challenging. Recently, a new technology, single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, was developed that could address these challenges, as it generates reads of several thousand bases. But, their broad application has been hampered by a high error rate. Therefore, hybrid approaches that use high-quality short reads to correct erroneous SMRT long reads have been developed. Still, current implementations have great demands on hardware, work only in well-defined computing infrastructures and reject a substantial amount of reads. This limits their usability considerably, especially in the case of large sequencing projects. Results : Here we present proovread , a hybrid correction pipeline for SMRT reads, which can be flexibly adapted on existing hardware and infrastructure from a laptop to a high-performance computing cluster. On genomic and transcriptomic test cases covering Escherichia coli , Arabidopsis thaliana and human, proovread achieved accuracies up to 99.9\% and outperformed the existing hybrid correction programs. Furthermore, proovread -corrected sequences were longer and the throughput was higher. Thus, proovread combines the most accurate correction results with an excellent adaptability to the available hardware. It will therefore increase the applicability and value of SMRT sequencing.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the development of diagnostics using artificial intelligence (AI) has been remarkable. AI algorithms can go beyond human reasoning and build diagnostic models from a number of complex combinations. Using next-generation sequencing technology, we identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) variants resistant to directing-acting antivirals (DAA) by whole genome sequencing of full-length HCV genomes, and applied these variants to various machine-learning algorithms to evaluate a preliminary predictive model. HCV genomic RNA was extracted from serum from 173 patients (109 with subsequent sustained virological response [SVR] and 64 without) before DAA treatment. HCV genomes from the 109 SVR and 64 non-SVR patients were randomly divided into a training data set (57 SVR and 29 non-SVR) and a validation-data set (52 SVR and 35 non-SVR). The training data set was subject to nine machine-learning algorithms selected to identify the optimized combination of functional variants in relation to SVR status following DAA therapy. Subsequently, the prediction model was tested by the validation-data set. The most accurate learning method was the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm (validation accuracy, 0.95; kappa statistic, 0.90; F-value, 0.94). The second-most accurate learning algorithm was Multi-layer perceptron. Unfortunately, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes algorithms could not be fitted with our data set due to low accuracy ({$<$} 0.8). Conclusively, with an accuracy rate of 95.4\% in the generalization performance evaluation, SVM was identified as the best algorithm. Analytical methods based on genomic analysis and the construction of a predictive model by machine-learning may be applicable to the selection of the optimal treatment for other viral infections and cancer.},

@article{haghshenasLordFASTSensitiveFast2019,
  abstract     = {Motivation: Recent advances in genomics and precision medicine have been made possible through the application of high throughput sequencing (HTS) to large collections of human genomes. Although HTS technologies have proven their use in cataloging human genome variation, computational analysis of the data they generate is still far from being perfect. The main limitation of Illumina and other popular sequencing technologies is their short read length relative to the lengths of (common) genomic repeats. Newer (single molecule sequencing - SMS) technologies such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore are producing longer reads, making it theoretically possible to overcome the difficulties imposed by repeat regions. Unfortunately, because of their high sequencing error rate, reads generated by these technologies are very difficult to work with and cannot be used in many of the standard downstream analysis pipelines. Note that it is not only difficult to find the correct mapping locations of such reads in a reference genome, but also to establish their correct alignment so as to differentiate sequencing errors from real genomic variants. Furthermore, especially since newer SMS instruments provide higher throughput, mapping and alignment need to be performed much faster than before, maintaining high sensitivity. Results: We introduce lordFAST, a novel long-read mapper that is specifically designed to align reads generated by PacBio and potentially other SMS technologies to a reference. lordFAST not only has higher sensitivity than the available alternatives, it is also among the fastest and has a very low memory footprint. Availability and implementation: lordFAST is implemented in C++ and supports multi-threading. The source code of lordFAST is available at https://github.com/vpc-ccg/lordfast.

Prevalence and incidence rates for HIV-1 and HIV-2 are described from 290 seroprevalent and 193 seroincident subjects who were among the 3,910 women enrolled between 1985 and 2004. We report a significant decrease of HIV-2 prevalence in the cohort, parallel to the introduction and rise of HIV-1 infection. In 328 HIV-1-infected women, a 385-bp C2-V3 fragment of the envelope gene was sequenced and classified into the following subtypes or recombinant forms: 239 (72\%) were subtype A [of which 180 (55\%) were CRF02\_AG and 53 (16\%) were A3], 10 (3\%) were B, 12 (4\%) were C, 11 (4\%) were D, 18 (6\%) were G, 24 (7\%) were CRF06\_cpx, and 7 (2\%) were CRF09\_cpx. We found an increasing proportion of CRF02\_AG over many years, but recently subsubtype A3 has over-taken CRF02\_AG, with the largest proportion of new infections. The predominance of existing HIV-1 subtypes did not preclude the emergence and increase of other closely related subtypes or recombinant forms. This 20-year prospective serological and sequence analysis of HIV viruses reveals a complex and changing HIV epidemic in Senegal.},

In contrast to previously described preparations, the RNA cleavage activity of the untagged RNase H domain was surprisingly similar to that of the full-length HIV-RT protein. Signature cleavages at 18 and 9 nucleotides downstream of a recessed RNA 5′-end were retained with the isolated RNase H domain. Activity was strongly decreased by deletion of 3 amino acids from the C-terminus, consistent with an important structural or functional role of the C-terminal α-helix. A prototype N-hydroxyimide (2-hydroxy-4H-isoquinoline-1,3-dione) was found to inhibit the activity of the isolated HIV RNase H domain as well as the RNase H activity of full-length HIV reverse transcriptase. In contrast, the compound did not significantly inhibit the structurally closely related Escherichia coli RNase HI. Specific binding of N-hydroxyimide compounds to the isolated RNase H domain was observed by protein fluorescence quenching.},

Reversal distance between permutations π and σis the minimum number of reversals to transform π into Α. Analysis of genome rearrangements in molecular biology started in the late 1930's, when Dobzhansky and Sturtevant published a milestone paper presenting a rearrangement scenario with 17 inversions between the species of Drosophilia. Analysis of genomes evolving by inversions leads to a combinatorial problem of sorting by reversals studied in detail recently. We study sorting of signed permutations by reversals, a problem that adequately models rearrangements in a small genomes like chloroplast or mitochondrial DNA. The previously suggested approximation algorithms for sorting signed permutations by reversals compute the reversal distance between permutations with an astonishing accuracy for both simulated and biological data. We prove a duality theorem explaining this intriguing performance and show that there exists a “hidden” parameter that allows one to compute the reversal distance between signed permutations in polynomial time.},

Asymptotically both are \$\textbackslash chi\^\{2\}\$-distributed so an obvious question is which of the two statistics that has a distribution that is closest to the \$\textbackslash chi\^\{2\}\$-distribution. Surprisingly the distribution of mutual information is much better approximated by a \$\textbackslash chi\^\{2\}\$-distribution than the \$\textbackslash chi\^\{2\}\$-statistic. For technical reasons we shall focus on the simplest case with one degree of freedom. We introduce the signed log-likelihood and demonstrate that its distribution function can be related to the distribution function of a standard Gaussian by inequalities. For the hypergeometric distribution we formulate a general conjecture about how close the signed log-likelihood is to a standard Gaussian, and this conjecture gives much more accurate estimates of the tail probabilities of this type of distribution than previously published results. The conjecture has been proved numerically in all cases relevant for testing independence and further evidence of its validity is given.},

MNHN-Tree-Tools does not rely on multiple sequence alignment and can thus be used on large datasets to infer a sequence tree. Herein, we outline two applications: a human alpha-satellite repeats classification and a tree of life derivation from 16S/18S rDNA sequences.Open source with a Zlib License via the Git protocol: https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/mnhn-tools/mnhn-tree-tools.A detailed users guide and tutorial: https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/mnhn-tools/mnhn-tree-tools-manual/-/raw/master/manual.pdf.http://treetools.haschka.net.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

At the same time, recent studies have statistically confirmed the non-stationarity of genomic non-numeric sequences and suggested the use of non-stationary analysis for these sequences. The conventional approach to analyze non-numeric genomic sequences using techniques specific to numerical data is to convert non-numerical data into numerical values in some way and then apply time or transform domain signal processing algorithms. Nevertheless, this approach raises questions regarding the relative magnitudes under numeric transforms, which can potentially lead to spurious patterns or misinterpretation of results.},

@book{hastieElementsStatisticalLearning2009,
  abstract    = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

The process of aligning these reads to a reference genome is time consuming and demands the development of fast and accurate alignment tools. However, the current proposed tools make different compromises between the accuracy and the speed of mapping. Moreover, many important aspects are overlooked while comparing the performance of a newly developed tool to the state of the art. Therefore, there is a need for an objective evaluation method that covers all the aspects. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking suite to extensively analyze sequencing tools with respect to various aspects and provide an objective comparison.},

@article{hauserBridgingGapHIV2019,
  abstract     = {The scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa substantially reduced AIDS-related deaths and new HIV infections. However, its success is threatened by the emergence of resistance to non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). The MARISA (Modelling Antiretroviral drug Resistance In South Africa) model presented here aims at investigating the time trends and factors driving NNRTI resistance in South Africa. MARISA is a compartmental model that includes the key aspects of the local HIV epidemic: continuum of care, disease progression, and gender. The dynamics of NNRTI resistance emergence and transmission are then added to this framework. Model parameters are informed using data from HIV cohorts participating in the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) and literature estimates, or fitted to UNAIDS estimates. Using this novel approach of triangulating clinical and resistance data from various sources, MARISA reproduces the time trends of HIV in South Africa in 2005–2016, with a decrease in new infections, undiagnosed individuals, and AIDS-related deaths. MARISA captures the dynamics of the spread of NNRTI resistance: high levels of acquired drug resistance (ADR, in 83\% of first-line treatment failures in 2016), and increasing transmitted drug resistance (TDR, in 8.1\% of ART initiators in 2016). Simulation of counter-factual scenarios reflecting alternative public health policies shows that increasing treatment coverage would have resulted in fewer new infections and deaths, at the cost of higher TDR (11.6\% in 2016 for doubling the treatment rate). Conversely, improving switching to second-line treatment would have led to lower TDR (6.5\% in 2016 for doubling the switching rate) and fewer new infections and deaths. Implementing drug resistance testing would have had little impact. The rapid ART scale-up and inadequate switching to second-line treatment were the key drivers of the spread of NNRTI resistance in South Africa. However, even though some interventions could have substantially reduced the level of NNRTI resistance, no policy including NNRTI-based first line regimens could have prevented this spread. Thus, by combining epidemiological data on HIV in South Africa with biological data on resistance evolution, our modelling approach identified key factors driving NNRTI resistance, highlighting the need of alternative first-line regimens.},

In contrast, lamivudine resistance was detected by phenotypic assay in rebound isolates from 14 of 17 subjects receiving triple-drug therapy, and genotypic analyses showed changes at codon 184 of reverse transcriptase in these 14 isolates. Mean random plasma indinavir concentrations in the 2 groups with rebound were similar to those of a control group with sustained viral suppression, although levels below 50 ng/mL were more frequent in the triple-drug group than in the control group (P = .03).ConclusionsLoss of viral suppression may be due to suboptimal antiviral potency, and selection of a predominantly indinavir-resistant virus population may be delayed for months even in the presence of ongoing indinavir therapy. The results suggest possible value in assessing strategies using drug components of failing regimens evaluated with resistance testing.},

@article{heiderMultilabelClassificationExploiting2013,
  abstract     = {Motivation: Antiretroviral treatment regimens can sufficiently suppress viral replication in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and prevent the progression of the disease. However, one of the factors contributing to the progression of the disease despite ongoing antiretroviral treatment is the emergence of drug resistance. The high mutation rate of HIV can lead to a fast adaptation of the virus under drug pressure, thus to failure of antiretroviral treatment due to the evolution of drug-resistant variants. Moreover, cross-resistance phenomena have been frequently found in HIV-1, leading to resistance not only against a drug from the current treatment, but also to other not yet applied drugs. Automatic classification and prediction of drug resistance is increasingly important in HIV research as well as in clinical settings, and to this end, machine learning techniques have been widely applied. Nevertheless, cross-resistance information was not taken explicitly into account, yet.Results: In our study, we demonstrated the use of cross-resistance information to predict drug resistance in HIV-1. We tested a set of more than 600 reverse transcriptase sequences and corresponding resistance information for six nucleoside analogues. Based on multilabel classification models and cross-resistance information, we were able to significantly improve overall prediction accuracy for all drugs, compared with single binary classifiers without any additional information. Moreover, we identified drug-specific patterns within the reverse transcriptase sequences that can be used to determine an optimal order of the classifiers within the classifier chains. These patterns are in good agreement with known resistance mutations and support the use of cross-resistance information in such prediction models.Contact:dominik.heider@uni-due.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The drug susceptibility data provides information for the clinician to select a treatment regimen effective against the predominant viral population circulating in the patient's blood. Compared to traditional phenotypic assays, the PhenoSense HIV assay uses a virus vector and a luciferase reporter gene to provide a quick and sensitive measure of viral replication. The main use of phenotypic assays at present is to identify those antiretroviral drugs that still retain activity against the patient's virus. Phenotypic assays are useful to provide guidance after treatment failure and to select a proper combination of drugs prior to initiation of therapy. They are also useful to detect transmission of resistance virus and to monitor HIV patients during early viral rebound. In essence, phenotypic testing provides information to target antiretroviral therapy against the predominant HIV variant in the patient for a prolonged suppression of viral replication, decreased mortality, and lower health-care costs.},

Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.},

Design Country-specific HIV-1 molecular epidemiology data were combined with estimates of the number of HIV-infected people in each country. Method Cross-sectional HIV-1 subtyping data were collected from 65913 samples in 109 countries between 2000 and 2007. The distribution of HIV-1 subtypes in individual countries was weighted according to the number of HIV-infected people in each country to generate estimates of regional and global HIV-1 subtype distribution for the periods 2000–2003 and 2004–2007. Results Analysis of the global distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants in the two time periods indicated a broadly stable distribution of HIV-1 subtypes worldwide with a notable increase in the proportion of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), a decrease in unique recombinant forms (URFs), and an overall increase in recombinants. In 2004–2007, subtype C accounted for nearly half (48\%) of all global infections, followed by subtypes A (12\%) and B (11\%), CRF02\_AG (8\%), CRF01\_AE (5\%), subtype G (5\%) and D(2\%). Subtypes F, H, J and K together cause fewer than 1\% of infections worldwide. Other CRFs and URFs are each responsible for 4\% of global infections, bringing the combined total of worldwide CRFs to 16\% and all recombinants (CRFs plus URFs) to 20\%. Conclusions The global and regional distributions of individual subtypes and recombinants are broadly stable, although CRFs may play an increasing role in the HIV pandemic. The global diversity of HIV-1 poses a formidable challenge to HIV vaccine development.},

  abstract     = {The degree to which evolution is predictable is a fundamental question in biology. Previous attempts to predict the evolution of protein sequences have been limited to specific proteins and to small changes, such as single-residue mutations. Here, we demonstrate that by using a protein language model to predict the local evolution within protein families, we recover a dynamic “vector field” of protein evolution that we call evolutionary velocity (evo-velocity). Evo-velocity generalizes to evolution over vastly different timescales, from viral proteins evolving over years to eukaryotic proteins evolving over geologic eons, and can predict the evolutionary dynamics of proteins that were not used to develop the original model. Evo-velocity also yields new evolutionary insights by predicting strategies of viral-host immune escape, resolving conflicting theories on the evolution of serpins, and revealing a key role of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of eukaryotic glycolysis.},

None of the SIV strains characterized so far are closely related to HIV-12–6. HIV-2, however, is closely related to SIV (SIVmac) isolated from captive rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)7. SIV infection of feral Asian macaques has not been demonstrated by serological surveys8,9. Thus, macaques may have acquired SIV in captivity by cross-species transmission from an SIV-infected African primate. Sooty mangabeys (Cercocebm atys), an African primate species indigenous to West Africa, however, are infected with SIV (SIVsm) both in captivity9–11and in the wild (P. Fultz, personal communication). We have molecularly cloned and sequenced SIVsm and report here that it is closely related to SIVmac and HIV-2. These results suggest that SIVsm has infected macaques in captivity and humans in West Africa and evolved as SIVmac and HIV-2, respectively.},

@article{HIVDrugResistance,
  abstract = {Objective: Determine the pattern of drug resistance among HIV infected drug exposed patients failing therapy in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Methods:  The protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) of 87 samples from 75 treatment exposed HIV infected patients failing therapy were PCR amplified, sequenced, subtyped and analyzed for the presence of drug resistance mutations. Results:  The most common drugs used were 3TC, AZT (or d4T) and EFV. The dominant subtypes were CRF06{\_}cpx (48{\%}) and CRF02{\_}AG (40{\%}). The prevalence of resistance mutations among patients failing therapy was: PR inhibitors (PI), 40{\%}; non-nucleoside RT-inhibitors (NNRTI), 76{\%} and nucleoside RT-inhibitors (NRTI), 85{\%}. Dominant mutations included M46I (37{\%}), 154V (26{\%}), V82A/T/F (30{\%}) in PR; K103N (44{\%}), G190A/S (16{\%}) and T215F/Y (48{\%}) (NRTIs) in RT. Some resistance mutations, notably D67N/G, K70R and L210W (thymidine analogue mutations-TAMs); K101E, V179E in RT, 154V, V82A/T/F and L90M in PR were significantly higher among CRF06{\_}cpx than CRF02{\_}AG strains (P < 0.05). Although not significant, other TAMs (M41L, T215F/Y, K219Q/E) also occurred more frequently among CRF06{\_}cpx strains as well. Conclusion:  There is a high prevalence of drug resistance mutations among ARV exposed patients in Burkina Faso with an unexpected subtype-specific difference. Validation of this result will require larger sample sizes and in vitro drug susceptibility studies with CRF06{\_}cpx strains.},

  abstract     = {HIV invasion through the mucosa of the female lower genital tract contributes the largest number of new HIV infections worldwide. The second leading site of viral invasion is the lower male genital tract, followed by invasion via the rectal mucosa in both women and men.Models of explanted human genital tissues have provided new insights into the mechanisms of sexual HIV transmission.Initial attachment of HIV-1 to the mucosa may be aided by cervical mucus and various gp120-binding surface receptors on epithelial cells. HIV-1 penetration into the genital mucosa occurs rapidly after exposure and is possibly enhanced by micro-abrasions or genital ulcer disease.In the human vagina, intraepithelial CD4+ T cells and CD1a+ Langerhans cells are the first cells infected by HIV-1.Vaginal Langerhans cells exhibit a high capacity to endocytose HIV-1 virions. C-type lectins such as dendritic-cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN; also known as CD209) or langerin (also known as CD207) appear to have little or no role in mediating this infection pathway.Genital CD4+ T cells express high levels of CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) are rapidly infected by HIV-1 and produce large quantities of viral progeny.In vitro studies have shown that dendritic cells use several pathways to enhance viral propagation to CD4+ T cells for productive infection. Presumably these also occur in the genital mucosa, but direct evidence is lacking.The highly protective effect of circumcision indicates that viral invasion in men occurs predominantly through the inner foreskin, where both CD1a+ Langerhans cells and CD4+ T cells are abundant. The second leading site of viral invasion in the male genital tract is probably the penile urethra.},

  abstract     = {Minimizers are widely used to sample representative k-mers from biological sequences in many applications, such as read mapping and taxonomy prediction. In most scenarios, having the minimizer scheme select as few k-mer positions as possible (i.e., having a low density) is desirable to reduce computation and memory cost. Despite the growing interest in minimizers, learning an effective scheme with optimal density is still an open question, as it requires solving an apparently challenging discrete optimization problem on the permutation space of k-mer orderings. Most existing schemes are designed to work well in expectation over random sequences, which have limited applicability to many practical tools. On the other hand, several methods have been proposed to construct minimizer schemes for a specific target sequence. These methods, however, only approximate the original objective with likewise discrete surrogate tasks that are not able to significantly improve the density performance. This article introduces the first continuous relaxation of the density minimizing objective, DeepMinimizer, which employs a novel Deep Learning twin architecture to simultaneously ensure both validity and performance of the minimizer scheme. Our surrogate objective is fully differentiable and, therefore, amenable to efficient gradient-based optimization using GPU computing. Finally, we demonstrate that DeepMinimizer discovers minimizer schemes that significantly outperform state-of-the-art constructions on human genomic sequences.},

Genomics data analytics at this scale requires overcoming performance bottlenecks, such as searching for short DNA sequences over long reference sequences. Results In this paper, we introduce LISA (Learned Indexes for Sequence Analysis), a novel learning-based approach to DNA sequence search. We focus on accelerating two of the most essential flavors of DNA sequence search—exact search and super-maximal exact match (SMEM) search. LISA builds on and extends FM-index, which is the state-of-the-art technique widely deployed in genomics tools. Experiments with human, animal, and plant genome datasets indicate that LISA achieves up to 2.2 and 10.8 speedups over the state-of-the-art FM-index based implementations for exact search and super-maximal exact match (SMEM) search, respectively.

Detection methods that use ensemble algorithms and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled the discovery of thousands of SVs, uncovering information about their ubiquity, relationship to disease and possible effects on biological mechanisms. Given the variability in SV type and size, along with unique detection biases of emerging genomic platforms, multiplatform discovery is necessary to resolve the full spectrum of variation. Here, we review modern approaches for investigating SVs and proffer that, moving forwards, studies integrating biological information with detection will be necessary to comprehensively understand the impact of SV in the human genome.},

@article{howisonMeasurementErrorVariantcalling2019,
  abstract     = {Next-generation deep sequencing of viral genomes, particularly on the Illumina platform, is increasingly applied in HIV research. Yet, there is no standard protocol or method used by the research community to account for measurement errors that arise during sample preparation and sequencing. Correctly calling high and low-frequency variants while controlling for erroneous variants is an important precursor to downstream interpretation, such as studying the emergence of HIV drug-resistance mutations, which in turn has clinical applications and can improve patient care.We developed a new variant-calling pipeline, hivmmer, for Illumina sequences from HIV viral genomes. First, we validated hivmmer by comparing it to other variant-calling pipelines on real HIV plasmid datasets. We found that hivmmer achieves a lower rate of erroneous variants, and that all methods agree on the frequency of correctly called variants. Next, we compared the methods on an HIV plasmid dataset that was sequenced using Primer ID, an amplicon-tagging protocol, which is designed to reduce errors and amplification bias during library preparation. We show that the Primer ID consensus exhibits fewer erroneous variants compared to the variant-calling pipelines, and that hivmmer more closely approaches this low error rate compared to the other pipelines. The frequency estimates from the Primer ID consensus do not differ significantly from those of the variant-calling pipelines.hivmmer is freely available for non-commercial use from https://github.com/kantorlab/hivmmer.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The polymorphisms involved in drug resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in HIV-1 CRF\_BC, the most prevalent HIV-1 strain in China, have been poorly characterized. RESULTS: To reveal the drug resistance mutations, we compared the gene sequences of pol region of HIV-1 CRF\_BC from 631 treatment-naïve and 363 treatment-experienced patients using the selection pressure-based method. We calculated an individual Ka/Ks value for each specific amino acid mutation. Result showed that eight polymorphic mutations (W88C, K101Q, I132L, R135L, T139K/R, H221Y and L228R) in RT for treatment-experienced patients were identified, while they, except for R135L, were completely absent in those from treatment-naïve patients. The I132L and T139K/R mutants exhibited high-level resistance to DLV and NVP and moderate resistance to TMC-125 and EFV, while the K101Q and H221Y mutants exhibited an increased resistance to all four NNRTIs tested. The W88C, R135L, and L228R may be RTI-induced adaptive mutations. Y181C+K101Q mutant showed a 2.5-, 4.4-, and 4.7-fold higher resistance to TMC-125, NVP and EFV, respectively, than Y181C alone mutant, while Y181C+H221Y or K103N+H221Y mutants had significantly higher resistance to all four NNRTIs than Y181C or K103N mutants. K103N+T139K and G190A+T139K mutant induce higher resistance (2.0∼14.2-fold and 1.5∼7.2-fold, respectively) to all four NNRTIs than K103N or G190A alone mutation. CONCLUSIONS: I132L and T139K/R are rare but critical mutations associated with NNRTI-resistance for some NNRTIs. K101Q, H221Y and T139K can enhance K103N/Y181C/G190A-assocated NNRTI-resistance. Monitoring these mutations will provide useful information for rational design of the NNRTI-based antiretroviral regimen for HIV-1 CRF\_BC-infected patients.},

@article{hueDemonstrationSustainedDrugResistant2009,
  abstract     = {Transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance is well-recognized and compromises response to first-line therapy. However, the population dynamics of transmitted resistance remains unclear, although previous models have assumed that such transmission reflects direct infection from treated individuals. We investigated whether population-based phylogenetic analyses would uncover lineages of resistant viruses circulating in untreated individuals. Through the phylogenetic analysis of 14,061 HIV type 1 (HIV-1) pol gene sequences generated in the United Kingdom from both treatment-na\"ive and -experienced individuals, we identified five treatment-independent viral clusters containing mutations conferring cross-resistance to antiretroviral drugs prescribed today in the United Kingdom. These viral lineages represent sustainable reservoirs of resistance among new HIV infections, independent of treatment. Dated phylogenies reconstructed through Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo inference indicated that these reservoirs originated between 1997 and 2003 and have persisted in the HIV-infected population for up to 8 years. Since our cohort does not represent all infected individuals within the United Kingdom, our results are likely to underestimate the number and size of the resistant reservoirs circulating among drug-na\"ive patients. The existence of sustained reservoirs of resistance in the absence of treatment has the capacity to threaten the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral therapy and suggests there is a limit to the decline of transmitted drug resistance. Given the current decrease in resistance transmitted from treated individuals, a greater proportion of resistance is likely to come from drug-na\"ive lineages. These findings provide new insights for the planning and management of treatment programs in resource-rich and developing countries.},

In particular, AlphaFold, a ground-breaking AI system, could potentially reshape structural biology. However, the utility of the PLM module in AlphaFold, Evoformer, has not been explored beyond structure prediction. In this paper, we investigate the representation ability of three popular PLMs: ESM-1b (single sequence), MSA-Transformer (multiple sequence alignment) and Evoformer (structural), with a special focus on Evoformer. Specifically, we aim to answer the following key questions: (i) Does the Evoformer trained as part of AlphaFold produce representations amenable to predicting protein function? (ii) If yes, can Evoformer replace ESM-1b and MSA-Transformer? (iii) How much do these PLMs rely on evolution-related protein data? In this regard, are they complementary to each other? We compare these models by empirical study along with new insights and conclusions. Finally, we release code and datasets for reproducibility.},

There are eight reported genotypes of HDV with unexplained variations in their geographical distribution and pathogenicity. The hepatitis D virion is composed of a coat of HBV envelope proteins surrounding the nucleocapsid, which consists of a single-stranded, circular RNA genome complexed with delta antigen, the viral protein. HDV is clinically important because although it suppresses HBV replication, it causes severe liver disease with rapid progression to cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation. The range of clinical presentation is wide, varying from mild disease to fulminant liver failure. The prevalence of HDV is declining in some endemic areas but increasing in northern and central Europe because of immigration. Treatment of HDV is with pegylated interferon alfa; however, response rates are poor. Increased understanding of the molecular virology of HDV will identify novel therapeutic targets for this most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis.},

However, the raw data from SMRT sequencing are of relatively low quality, with a random error rate of approximately 15~\%, for which error correction using next-generation sequencing (NGS) short reads is typically necessary. Few tools have been designed that apply a hybrid sequencing approach that combines NGS and SMRT data, and the most popular existing tool for error correction, LSC, has computing resource requirements that are too intensive for most laboratory and research groups.

Thus, we developed NextPolish, a tool that efficiently corrects sequence errors in genomes assembled with long reads. This new tool consists of two interlinked modules that are designed to score and count K-mers from high quality short reads, and to polish genome assemblies containing large numbers of base errors.When evaluated for the speed and efficiency using human and a plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) genomes, NextPolish outperformed Pilon by correcting sequence errors faster, and with a higher correction accuracy.NextPolish is implemented in C and Python.

These successes were buoyed by additional positive results from the TDF2 and Partners PrEP trials. Although no seroconverters in either arm of CAPRISA developed resistance to tenofovir, 2 participants in iPrEx with undetected, seronegative acute HIV infection were randomized to receive daily oral tenofovir-emtricitabine and resistance to emtricitabine was later discovered in both men. A similar case in the TDF2 study resulted in resistance to both ARVs. These cases prompted us to examine existing literature on the nature of resistance mutations elicited by ARVs used for PrEP. Here, we discuss the impact of signature mutations selected by PrEP, how rapidly these emerge with daily ARV exposure, and the individual-level and public health consequences of ARV resistance.},

  abstract     = {The sequence of the human genome encodes the genetic instructions for human physiology, as well as rich information about human evolution. In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers ∼99\% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of ∼1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000–25,000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead.},

The genomics of SARS-CoV-2 has been instrumental to the timely development of diagnostics and vaccines and in elucidating transmission dynamics. Global disease control programmes, including those for tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, foodborne pathogens, and antimicrobial resistance, also recommend genomics-based surveillance as an integral strategy towards control and elimination of these diseases. Despite the potential benefits, capacity remains low for many public health programmes in Africa. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity to reassess and strengthen surveillance systems and potentially integrate emerging technologies for preparedness of future epidemics and control of endemic diseases. We discuss opportunities and challenges for integrating pathogen genomics into public health surveillance systems in Africa. Improving accessibility through the creation of functional continent-wide networks, building multipathogen sequencing cores, training a critical mass of local experts, development of standards and policies to facilitate best practices for data sharing, and establishing a community of practice of genomics experts are all needed to use genomics for improved disease surveillance in Africa. Coordination and leadership are also crucial, which the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention seeks to provide through its institute for pathogen genomics.},

To overcome long execution times for simulated annealing, we utilized a parallel computer. A sequential algorithm, a simple parallel algorithm and the temperature parallel algorithm were tested on a problem. The results were compared with the result obtained by a conventional tree-based algorithm where alignments were merged by two-' dynamic programming. Every annealing algorithm produced a better energy value than the conventional algorithm. The best energy value, which probably represents the optimal solution, wns reached within a reasonable time by both of the parallel annealing algorithms. We consider the temperature parallel algorithm of simulated annealing to be the most suitable for finding the optimal multiple sequence alignment because the algorithm does not require any scheduling for optimization.

To tackle this issue, the application of natural language processing (NLP) to biological sequence analysis has received increased attention. In this method, biological sequences are regarded as sentences while the single nucleic acids/amino acids or k-mers in these sequences represent the words. Embedding is an essential step in NLP, which performs the conversion of these words into vectors. Specifically, representation learning is an approach used for this transformation process, which can be applied to biological sequences. Vectorized biological sequences can then be applied for function and structure estimation, or as input for other probabilistic models. Considering the importance and growing trend for the application of representation learning to biological research, in the present study, we have reviewed the existing knowledge in representation learning for biological sequence analysis.},

  abstract     = {Whole-genome alignment is an important problem in genomics for comparing different species, mapping draft assemblies to reference genomes and identifying repeats. However, for large plant and animal genomes, this task remains compute and memory intensive. In addition, current practical methods lack any guarantee on the characteristics of output alignments, thus making them hard to tune for different application requirements.We introduce an approximate algorithm for computing local alignment boundaries between long DNA sequences. Given a minimum alignment length and an identity threshold, our algorithm computes the desired alignment boundaries and identity estimates using kmer-based statistics, and maintains sufficient probabilistic guarantees on the output sensitivity. Further, to prioritize higher scoring alignment intervals, we develop a plane-sweep based filtering technique which is theoretically optimal and practically efficient. Implementation of these ideas resulted in a fast and accurate assembly-to-genome and genome-to-genome mapper. As a result, we were able to map an error-corrected whole-genome NA12878 human assembly to the hg38 human reference genome in about 1\,min total execution time and \&lt;4 GB memory using eight CPU threads, achieving significant improvement in memory-usage over competing methods. Recall accuracy of computed alignment boundaries was consistently found to be \&gt;97\% on multiple datasets. Finally, we performed a sensitive self-alignment of the human genome to compute all duplications of length ≥1 Kbp and ≥90\% identity. The reported output achieves good recall and covers twice the number of bases than the current UCSC browser’s segmental duplication annotation.https://github.com/marbl/MashMap},

In this article, we combine a fast approximate read mapping algorithm based on minimizers with a novel MinHash identity estimation technique to achieve both scalability and precision. In contrast to prior methods, we develop a mathematical framework that defines the types of mapping targets we uncover, establish probabilistic estimates of p-value and sensitivity, and demonstrate tolerance for alignment error rates up to 20\%. With this framework, our algorithm automatically adapts to different minimum length and identity requirements and provides both positional and identity estimates for each mapping reported. For mapping human PacBio reads to the hg38 reference, our method is 290\,×\,faster than Burrows–Wheeler Aligner-MEM with a lower memory footprint and recall rate of 96\%. We further demonstrate the scalability of our method by mapping noisy PacBio reads (each ≥5\,kbp in length) to the complete NCBI RefSeq database containing 838 Gbp of sequence and {$>$}60,000 genomes.},

  abstract     = {Approximately 5–10\% of the human genome remains inaccessible due to the presence of repetitive sequences such as segmental duplications and tandem repeat arrays. We show that existing long-read mappers often yield incorrect alignments and variant calls within long, near-identical repeats, as they remain vulnerable to allelic bias. In the presence of a nonreference allele within a repeat, a read sampled from that region could be mapped to an incorrect repeat copy. To address this limitation, we developed a new long-read mapping method, Winnowmap2, by using minimal confidently alignable substrings. Winnowmap2 computes each read mapping through a collection of confident subalignments. This approach is more tolerant of structural variation and more sensitive to paralog-specific variants within repeats. Our experiments highlight that Winnowmap2 successfully addresses the issue of allelic bias, enabling more accurate downstream variant calls in repetitive sequences.},

@article{jainWeightedMinimizerSampling2020,
  abstract     = {In this era of exponential data growth, minimizer sampling has become a standard algorithmic technique for rapid genome sequence comparison. This technique yields a sub-linear representation of sequences, enabling their comparison in reduced space and time. A key property of the minimizer technique is that if two sequences share a substring of a specified length, then they can be guaranteed to have a matching minimizer. However, because the k-mer distribution in eukaryotic genomes is highly uneven, minimizer-based tools (e.g. Minimap2, Mashmap) opt to discard the most frequently occurring minimizers from the genome to avoid excessive false positives. By doing so, the underlying guarantee is lost and accuracy is reduced in repetitive genomic regions.We introduce a novel weighted-minimizer sampling algorithm. A unique feature of the proposed algorithm is that it performs minimizer sampling while considering a weight for each k-mer; i.e. the higher the weight of a k-mer, the more likely it is to be selected. By down-weighting frequently occurring k-mers, we are able to meet both objectives: (i) avoid excessive false-positive matches and (ii) maintain the minimizer match guarantee. We tested our algorithm, Winnowmap, using both simulated and real long-read data and compared it to a state-of-the-art long read mapper, Minimap2. Our results demonstrate a reduction in the mapping error-rate from 0.14\% to 0.06\% in the recently finished human X chromosome (154.3 Mbp), and from 3.6\% to 0\% within the highly repetitive X centromere (3.1 Mbp). Winnowmap improves mapping accuracy within repeats and achieves these results with sparser sampling, leading to better index compression and competitive runtimes. Winnowmap is built on top of the Minimap2 codebase and is available at https://github.com/marbl/winnowmap.},

@article{jensenReliablePhenotypePredictor2006,
  abstract     = {In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype B infections, the emergence of viruses able to use CXCR4 as a coreceptor is well documented and associated with accelerated CD4 decline and disease progression. However, in HIV-1 subtype C infections, responsible for more than 50\% of global infections, CXCR4 usage is less common, even in individuals with advanced disease. A reliable phenotype prediction method based on genetic sequence analysis could provide a rapid and less expensive approach to identify possible CXCR4 variants and thus increase our understanding of subtype C coreceptor usage. For subtype B V3 loop sequences, genotypic predictors have been developed based on position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM). In this study, we apply this methodology to a training set of 279 subtype C sequences of known phenotypes (228 non-syncytium-inducing [NSI] CCR5+ and 51 SI CXCR4+ sequences) to derive a C-PSSM predictor. Specificity and sensitivity distributions were estimated by combining data set bootstrapping with leave-one-out cross-validation, with random sampling of single sequences from individuals on each bootstrap iteration. The C-PSSM had an estimated specificity of 94\% (confidence interval [CI], 92\% to 96\%) and a sensitivity of 75\% (CI, 68\% to 82\%), which is significantly more sensitive than predictions based on other methods, including a commonly used method based on the presence of positively charged residues (sensitivity, 47.8\%). A specificity of 83\% and a sensitivity of 83\% were achieved with a validation set of 24 SI and 47 NSI unique subtype C sequences. The C-PSSM performs as well on subtype C V3 loops as existing subtype B-specific methods do on subtype B V3 loops. We present bioinformatic evidence that particular sites may influence coreceptor usage differently, depending on the subtype.},

One essential aspect in this context is the assessment of the quality of the computed approximate solutions. In this paper we present a lower bound in terms of a linear program for this purpose. It is applicable to any pattern space. The only assumption we make is that the distance function used for the definition of generalized median is a metric. We will prove the optimality of the lower bound, i.e. it will be shown that no better one exists when considering all possible instances of generalized median problems. An experimental verification in the domain of strings and graphs shows the tightness, and thus the usefulness, of the proposed lower bound.},

@article{jiDNABERTPretrainedBidirectional2021,
  abstract     = {Deciphering the language of non-coding DNA is one of the fundamental problems in genome research. Gene regulatory code is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios.To address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation, named DNABERT, to capture global and transferrable understanding of genomic DNA sequences based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared DNABERT to the most widely used programs for genome-wide regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use, accuracy and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites and transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using small task-specific labeled data. Further, DNABERT enables direct visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic relationship within input sequences for better interpretability and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-trained DNABERT with human genome can even be readily applied to other organisms with exceptional performance. We anticipate that the pre-trained DNABERT model can be fined tuned to many other sequence analyses tasks.The source code, pretrained and finetuned model for DNABERT are available at GitHub (https://github.com/jerryji1993/DNABERT).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Models exhibiting the former property are many times more complex and opaque, while interpretable models may lack the necessary accuracy. The trade-off between accuracy and interpretability for predictive insilico modeling is investigated. Method: A number of state-of-the-art methods for generating accurate models are compared with state-of-the-art methods for generating transparent models. Conclusion: Results on 16 biopharmaceutical classification tasks demonstrate that, although the opaque methods generally obtain higher accuracies than the transparent ones, one often only has to pay a quite limited penalty in terms of predictive performance when choosing an interpretable model.},

  abstract     = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The growing use of next-generation sequencing and enlarged sequencing throughput require efficient short-read alignment, where seeding is one of the major performance bottlenecks. The key challenge in the seeding phase is searching for exact matches of substrings of short reads in the reference DNA sequence. Existing algorithms, however, present limitations in performance due to their frequent memory accesses.This article presents BWA-MEME, the first full-fledged short read alignment software that leverages learned indices for solving the exact match search problem for efficient seeding. BWA-MEME is a practical and efficient seeding algorithm based on a suffix array search algorithm that solves the challenges in utilizing learned indices for SMEM search which is extensively used in the seeding phase. Our evaluation shows that BWA-MEME achieves up to 3.45× speedup in seeding throughput over BWA-MEM2 by reducing the number of instructions by 4.60×, memory accesses by 8.77× and LLC misses by 2.21×, while ensuring the identical SAM output to BWA-MEM2.The source code and test scripts are available for academic use at https://github.com/kaist-ina/BWA-MEME/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{jurtzIntroductionDeepLearning2017,
  abstract     = {Motivation: Deep neural network architectures such as convolutional and long short-term memory networks have become increasingly popular as machine learning tools during the recent years. The availability of greater computational resources, more data, new algorithms for training deep models and easy to use libraries for implementation and training of neural networks are the drivers of this development. The use of deep learning has been especially successful in image recognition; and the development of tools, applications and code examples are in most cases centered within this field rather than within biology. Results: Here, we aim to further the development of deep learning methods within biology by providing application examples and ready to apply and adapt code templates. Given such examples, we illustrate how architectures consisting of convolutional and long short-term memory neural networks can relatively easily be designed and trained to state-of-the-art performance on three biological sequence problems: prediction of subcellular localization, protein secondary structure and the binding of peptides to MHC Class II molecules.

An accurate phylogenetic tree underpins our understanding of the major transitions in evolution, such as the emergence of new body plans or metabolism, and is key to inferring the origin of new genes, detecting molecular adaptation, understanding morphological character evolution and reconstructing demographic changes in recently diverged species. Although data are ever more plentiful and powerful analysis methods are available, there remain many challenges to reliable tree building. Here, we discuss the major steps of phylogenetic analysis, including identification of orthologous genes or proteins, multiple sequence alignment, and choice of substitution models and inference methodologies.

@article{karlinMethodsAssessingStatistical1990,
  abstract     = {An unusual pattern in a nucleic acid or protein sequence or a region of strong similarity shared by two or more sequences may have biological significance. It is therefore desirable to know whether such a pattern can have arisen simply by chance. To identify interesting sequence patterns, appropriate scoring values can be asigned to the individual residues of a single sequence or to sets of residues when several sequences are compared. For single sequences, such scores can reflect biophysical properties such as charge, volume, hydrophobicity, or secondary structure potential; for multiple sequences, they can reflect nucleotide or amino acid similarity measured in a wide variety of ways. Using an appropriate random model, we present a theory that provides precise numerical formulas for assessing the statistical significance of any region with high aggregate score. A second class of results describes the composition of high-scoring segments. In certain contexts, these permit the choice of scoring systems which are "optimal" for distinguishing biologically relevant patterns. Examples are given of applications of the theory to a variety of protein sequences, highlighting segments with unusual biological features. These include distinctive charge regions in transcription factors and protooncogene products, pronounced hydrophobic segments in various receptor and transport proteins, and statistically ignificant subalignments involving the recently characterized cystic fibrosis gene.},

(i) Homo logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to a sequence composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method (FFT‐NS‐2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT‐NS‐i), are implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT‐NS‐2 and FFT‐NS‐i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT‐NS‐2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT‐NS‐i is over 100 times faster than T‐COFFEE, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Objective:~         To evaluate phenotypic drug susceptibility and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor hypersusceptibility as predictors of the time to virological failure.         Design:~         In a randomized clinical trial, phenotypic susceptibility was retrospectively determined among 131 exclusively nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-experienced patients with baseline HIV-RNA levels greater than 2000 copies/ml. Subjects were assigned two NRTI drugs and were randomly assigned to nelfinavir, efavirenz, or both. Virological failure was defined as two HIV-RNA measurements of 2000 copies/ml or greater at or after week 16 and before treatment discontinuation.         Methods:~         Using biological cut-offs to define resistance, assigned NRTI and randomized drug regimens, continuous and dichotomous phenotypic susceptibility scores (PSS) were calculated for each virus. Efavirenz hypersusceptibility as a dichotomous value was defined as less than 0.4-fold resistance. Associations between virological failure and continuous and dichotomous PSS were evaluated using Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models.         Results:~         A higher baseline viral load (P {$<$} 0.02) and lower dichotomous or continuous baseline PSS (P = 0.004 and P {$<$} 0.001, respectively) were independently associated with virological failure. In the 85 subjects who received efavirenz, efavirenz hypersusceptibility (P = 0.042, hazard ratio 0.43, 95\% confidence interval 0.19–0.97) was independently associated with a reduced risk of virological failure.         Conclusion:~         Reduced phenotypic susceptibility was a significant independent risk factor for virological failure. The presence of efavirenz hypersusceptibility appeared to enhance virological responses during treatment with efavirenz in combination with NRTIs. The retrospective calculation of continuous PSS accurately identified treatment regimens containing sufficient drug activity to prevent virological failure.},

  abstract   = {Deemed "one of the top ten data mining mistakes", leakage is essentially the introduction of information about the data mining target, which should not be legitimately available to mine from. In addition to our own industry experience with real-life projects, controversies around several major public data mining competitions held recently such as the INFORMS 2010 Data Mining Challenge and the IJCNN 2011 Social Network Challenge are evidence that this issue is as relevant today as it has ever been. While acknowledging the importance and prevalence of leakage in both synthetic competitions and real-life data mining projects, existing literature has largely left this idea unexplored. What little has been said turns out not to be broad enough to cover more complex cases of leakage, such as those where the classical i.i.d. assumption is violated, that have been recently documented. In our new approach, these cases and others are explained by explicitly defining modeling goals and analyzing the broader framework of the data mining problem. The resulting definition enables us to derive general methodology for dealing with the issue. We show that it is possible to avoid leakage with a simple specific approach to data management followed by what we call a learn-predict separation, and present several ways of detecting leakage when the modeler has no control over how the data have been collected.},

Despite the importance suggested by many noncoding variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanisms. Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on a recent machine learning advance—deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.},

However, one transmission event involving SIVcpz from chimpanzees gave rise to group M HIV-1, with M being the principal strain of HIV-1 responsible for the AIDS pandemic. Vpu is an HIV-1 accessory protein generated from Env/Vpu encoded bicistronic mRNA and localized in cytosolic and membrane regions of cells capable of being infected by HIV-1 and that regulate HIV-1 infection and transmission by downregulating BST-2, CD4 proteins levels, and immune evasion. This review will focus of critical aspects of Vpu including its zoonosis, the adaptive hurdles to cross-species transmission, and future perspectives and broad implications of Vpu in HIV-1 infection and dissemination.},

@incollection{kieferEffectsUltravioletRadiation2007,
  abstract  = {UV radiation is selectively absorbed by DNA, mainly in the UV-B and the UV-C regions. Excitation of DNA leads to typical photoproducts, the most important being pyrimidine dimers and the so-called 6-4-photoproduct. The yield of strand breaks is very low directly after exposure, but they may be formed indirectly upon further incubation. Although DNA absorbs only weakly in the UV-A region, it may be damaged indirectly via endogenous photosensitisers. Photoproducts are subject to repair processes which are genetically determined. Photoreactivation splits selectively pyrimidine dimers but it is limited to lower eukaryotes and does not occur in mammalian cells. Nucleotide excision repair acts on various types of damage. UVinduced damage manifests itself also at the level of chromosomes. Chromatid-type aberrations are more frequent with UV irradiation than chromosomal aberrations. The action spectrum for their formation demonstrates that an indirect mechanism plays an important role in the UV-A region. Also micronuclei are found after broadband UV exposure which are presumably due to indirectly formed double-strand breaks. UV radiation is a strong inducer of sister-chromatid exchanges, in contrast to ionising radiation, where the yields are low. This suggests that strand breaks play only a minor role.},

  abstract     = {Multiple sequence alignment is a useful technique for studying molecular evolution and analyzing structure-sequence relationships. Dynamic programming of multiple sequence alignment has been widely used to find an optimal alignment. However, dynamic programming does not allow for certain types of gap costs, and it limits the number of sequences that can be aligned due to its high computational complexity. The focus of this paper is to use simulated annealing as the basis for developing an efficient multiple sequence alignment algorithm. An algorithm called Multiple Sequence Alignment using Simulated Annealing (MSASA) has been developed. The computational complexity of MSASA is significantly reduced by replacing the high-temperature phase of the annealing process by a fast heuristic algorithm. This heuristic algorithm facilitates in minimizing the solution set of the low-temperature phase of the annealing process. Compared to the dynamic programming approach, MSASA can (i) use natural gap costs which can generate better solution, (ii) align more sequences and (iii) take less computation time.},

Embedding a biological sequence over a nucleotide or amino acid alphabet in a lower dimensional vector space makes the data more amenable for use by current machine learning tools, provided the quality of embedding is high and it captures the most meaningful information of the original sequences. Motivated by recent advances in the text document embedding literature, we present a new method, called seq2vec, to represent a complete biological sequence in an Euclidean space. The new representation has the potential to capture the contextual information of the original sequence necessary for sequence comparison tasks.

  abstract     = {Several genotypic resistance algorithms have been proposed for quantitation of the degree of phenotypic resistance to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor (PI) lopinavir (LPV), including the original LPV mutation score. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated 21 codons in HIV protease known to be associated with PI resistance in a large antiretroviral agent-experienced observational patient cohort, “Autorisation Temporaire d'Utilization” (ATU), to assess whether a more optimal algorithm could be derived by using virologic response data from patients treated with LPV in combination with ritonavir (LPV/r). Five of the 11 mutations constituting the LPV mutation score were not associated with a virologic response, while 4 additional mutations not included in this score demonstrated an association. Therefore, the LPV ATU score, which includes mutations at codons 10, 20, 24, 33, 36, 47, 48, 54, 82, and 84, was constructed and shown in two different types of multivariable analyses of the ATU cohort to be a better predictor of the virologic response than the LPV mutation score. The LPV ATU score was also more strongly associated with a virologic response when it was applied to independent clinical trial populations of PI-experienced patients receiving LPV/r. This study provides the basis for a new genotypic resistance algorithm that is useful for predicting the antiviral activities of LPV/r-based regimens in PI-experienced patients. The refined algorithm may be useful in making clinical treatment decisions and in refining genetic and pharmacologic methods for assessing the activity of LPV/r.},

Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of \$N\$ times, where \$N\$ is the number of layers.

  abstract     = {DNA polymerase and RNase H (RH) activities of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) have been recognized as potential targets for antiretroviral therapy for more than 15 years. The development of medicines targeting the DNA polymerase activity has been highly successful, with currently 12 drugs approved for the treatment of HIV infection and more candidates in preclinical and clinical development. In contrast, the discovery of potent and selective inhibitors of HIV RH has been slow, and inhibitors of this enzyme function have yet to reach the clinical development stage. Selective HIV RH inhibitors are likely to provide significant clinical benefit in combination therapies, considering the high prevalence of HIV strains resistant to currently available antiretroviral therapies. Recent progress in a number of key areas has provided new impetus to the discovery of HIV RH inhibitors. High throughput assay systems based on fluorescence detection have been developed, which facilitate screening of inhibitor candidates. Substantial progress has been made in expression, purification, crystallisation and solution studies of HIV RT and RH, in particular with regards to aspects of structural dynamics. Crystal structures of active site binding and allosteric HIV RH inhibitors bound to HIV RT and RH have been obtained. Finally, an improved understanding of similarities and differences in enzymatic mechanisms between related nuclease enzymes has provided new concepts for achieving inhibitor selectivity. Together, these developments provide promising new starting points for the rational design of selective HIV RH inhibitors.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled a dramatic expansion of clinical genetic testing both for inherited conditions and diseases such as cancer. Accurate variant calling in NGS data is a critical step upon which virtually all downstream analysis and interpretation processes rely. Just as NGS technologies have evolved considerably over the past 10~years, so too have the software tools and approaches for detecting sequence variants in clinical samples. In this review, I discuss the current best practices for variant calling in clinical sequencing studies, with a particular emphasis on trio sequencing for inherited disorders and somatic mutation detection in cancer patients. I describe the relative strengths and weaknesses of panel, exome, and whole-genome sequencing for variant detection. Recommended tools and strategies for calling variants of different classes are also provided, along with guidance on variant review, validation, and benchmarking to ensure optimal performance. Although NGS technologies are continually evolving, and new capabilities (such as long-read single-molecule sequencing) are emerging, the “best practice” principles in this review should be relevant to clinical variant calling in the long term.},

@article{konishiPrincipalComponentAnalysis2019,
  abstract     = {Sequence data is now widely used to observe relationships among organisms. However, understanding structure of the qualitative data is challenging. Conventionally, the relationships are analysed using a dendrogram that estimates a tree shape. This approach has difficulty in verifying the appropriateness of the tree shape; rather, horizontal gene transfers and mating can make the shape of the relationship as networks. As a connection-free approach, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to summarize the distance matrix, which records distances between each combination of samples. However, this approach is limited regarding the treatment of information of sequence motifs; distances caused by different motifs are mixed up. This hides clues to figure out how the samples are different. As any bases may change independently, a sequence is multivariate data essentially. Hence, differences among samples and bases that contribute to the difference should be observed coincidentally. To archive this, the sequence matrix is transferred to boolean vector and directly analysed by using PCA. The effects are confirmed in diversity of Asiatic lion and human as well as environmental DNA. Resolution of samples and robustness of calculation is improved. Relationship of a direction of difference and causative nucleotides has become obvious at a glance.},

Using parallel supercomputers and assuming a constant rate of evolution, we applied maximum-likelihood phylogenetic methods to unprecedented amounts of data for this calculation. We validated our approach by correctly estimating the timing of two historically documented points. Using a comprehensive full-length envelope sequence alignment, we estimated the date of the last common ancestor of the main group of HIV-1 to be 1931 (1915-41). Analysis of a gag gene alignment, subregions of envelope including additional sequences, and a method that relaxed the assumption of a strict molecular clock also supported these results.},

  abstract     = {Long-read single-molecule sequencing has revolutionized de novo genome assembly and enabled the automated reconstruction of reference-quality genomes. However, given the relatively high error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate assembly of large repeats and closely related haplotypes remains challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a successor of Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage requirements, and improves assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an order of magnitude on large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2. These advances result from new overlapping and assembly algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based on tf-idf weighted MinHash and a sparse assembly graph construction that avoids collapsing diverged repeats and haplotypes. We demonstrate that Canu can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and near-complete eukaryotic chromosomes using either Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore technologies and achieves a contig NG50 of {$>$}21 Mbp on both human and Drosophila melanogaster PacBio data sets. For assembly structures that cannot be linearly represented, Canu provides graph-based assembly outputs in graphical fragment assembly (GFA) format for analysis or integration with complementary phasing and scaffolding techniques. The combination of such highly resolved assembly graphs with long-range scaffolding information promises the complete and automated assembly of complex genomes.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of protein three-dimensional structure from amino acid sequence has been a grand challenge problem in computational biophysics for decades, owing to its intrinsic scientific interest and also to the many potential applications for robust protein structure prediction algorithms, from genome interpretation to protein function prediction. More recently, the inverse problem — designing an amino acid sequence that will fold into a specified three-dimensional structure — has attracted growing attention as a potential route to the rational engineering of proteins with functions useful in biotechnology and medicine. Methods for the prediction and design of protein structures have advanced dramatically in the past decade. Increases in computing power and the rapid growth in protein sequence and structure databases have fuelled the development of new data-intensive and computationally demanding approaches for structure prediction. New algorithms for designing protein folds and protein–protein interfaces have been used to engineer novel high-order assemblies and to design from scratch fluorescent proteins with novel or enhanced properties, as well as signalling proteins with therapeutic potential. In this Review, we describe current approaches for protein structure prediction and design and highlight a selection of the successful applications they have enabled.},

  abstract     = {Drug resistant HIV is a major threat to the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. Around 10\% of ART-naïve patients in Europe are infected with drug-resistant HIV type 1. Hence it is important to understand the dynamics of transmitted drug resistance evolution. Thanks to routinely performed drug resistance tests, HIV sequence data is increasingly available and can be used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship among viral lineages. In this study we employ a phylodynamic approach to quantify the fitness costs of major resistance mutations in the Swiss HIV cohort. The viral phylogeny reflects the transmission tree, which we model using stochastic birth–death-sampling processes with two types: hosts infected by a sensitive or resistant strain. This allows quantification of fitness cost as the ratio between transmission rates of hosts infected by drug resistant strains and transmission rates of hosts infected by drug sensitive strains. The resistance mutations 41L, 67N, 70R, 184V, 210W, 215D, 215S and 219Q (nRTI-related) and 103N, 108I, 138A, 181C, 190A (NNRTI-related) in the reverse trancriptase and the 90M mutation in the protease gene are included in this study. Among the considered resistance mutations, only the 90M mutation in the protease gene was found to have significantly higher fitness than the drug sensitive strains. The following mutations associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were found to be less fit than the sensitive strains: 67N, 70R, 184V, 219Q. The highest posterior density intervals of the transmission ratios for the remaining resistance mutations included in this study all included 1, suggesting that these mutations do not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility within the Swiss HIV cohort. These patterns are consistent with alternative measures of the fitness cost of resistance mutations. Overall, we have developed and validated a novel phylodynamic approach to estimate the transmission fitness cost of drug resistance mutations.},

@article{kujovichFactorLeidenThrombophilia2011,
  abstract     = {Factor V Leiden is a genetic disorder characterized by a poor anticoagulant response to activated Protein C and an increased risk for venous thromboembolism. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are the most common manifestations, but thrombosis in unusual locations also occurs. The current evidence suggests that the mutation has at most a modest effect on recurrence risk after initial treatment of a first venous thromboembolism. Factor V Leiden is also associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased relative risk for pregnancy loss and possibly other obstetric complications, although the probability of a successful pregnancy outcome is high. The clinical expression of Factor V Leiden is influenced by the number of Factor V Leiden alleles, coexisting genetic and acquired thrombophilic disorders, and circumstantial risk factors. Diagnosis requires the activated Protein C resistance assay (a coagulation screening test) or DNA analysis of the F5 gene, which encodes the Factor V protein. The first acute thrombosis is treated according to standard guidelines. Decisions regarding the optimal duration of anticoagulation are based on an individualized assessment of the risks for venous thromboembolism recurrence and anticoagulant-related bleeding. In the absence of a history of thrombosis, long-term anticoagulation is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic Factor V Leiden heterozygotes, although prophylactic anticoagulation may be considered in high-risk clinical settings. In the absence of evidence that early diagnosis reduces morbidity or mortality, decisions regarding testing at-risk family members should be made on an individual basis.},

In addition, MEGA computes statistical quantities such as nucleotide and amino acid frequencies, transition/transversion biases, codon frequencies (codon usage tables), and the number of variable sites in specified segments in nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Advanced on-screen sequence data and phylogenetictree editors facilitate publication-quality outputs with a wide range of printers.

NGS has tremendously improved sequencing output while being more time and cost-efficient in comparison to Sanger sequencing. The authors describe short-read sequencing approaches, such as sequencing by synthesis, ion semiconductor sequencing, and nanoball sequencing. Third-generation long-read sequencing now promises to overcome many of the limitations of short-read sequencing, such as the ability to reliably resolve repeat sequences and large genomic rearrangements. By combining complementary methods with massively parallel DNA sequencing, a greater insight into the biological context of disease mechanisms is now possible. Emerging methodologies, such as advances in nanopore technology, in situ nucleic acid sequencing, and microscopy-based sequencing, will continue the rapid evolution of this area.

@inproceedings{kunanbayevComplexEncoding2021,
  abstract   = {A salient problem in machine learning is transforming categorical variables into efficient numerical features. This focus is warranted due to the ubiquity of categorical data in real-world applications but, on the contrary, the development of many machine learning methods based on the assumption of having numerical variables. Perhaps the most popular existing categorical to numerical conversion techniques include one-hot encoding, thermometer encoding, and ordinal (integer) encoding. One-hot and thermometer encodings become computationally inefficient and may lead to ill-conditioning for high-cardinality categorical variables as they create high-dimensional data matrices. As ordinal encoding does not change data dimensionality, it is significantly more memory-efficient; however, the spurious ordering induced by ordinal encoding among unordered categorical values can hamstring the performance of constructed predictive models. In this paper, we propose a new encoding technique, namely complex encoding, that provides a symmetric representation of categorical values in the complex plane. To show the efficacy of the complex encoding in terms of error rate and memory usage, we conducted a set of numerical experiments using real datasets and the family of linear discriminant functions for complex Gaussian distributions. Empirical results show that not only complex encoding avoids the ill-conditioning problem of one-hot and thermometer encodings, it can generally lead to a comparable or higher classification accuracy with respect to others (when they are applicable) at the expense of only about two-fold increase in memory usage with respect to ordinal encoding.},

Extensive studies on resistance to viral protease inhibitors, particularly those of HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease, revealed a plethora of information on the structural and molecular mechanisms underlying resistance. These insights led to several strategies to improve viral protease inhibitors to counter resistance, such as exploiting the essential biological function and leveraging evolutionary constraints. Incorporation of these strategies into structure-based drug design can minimize vulnerability to resistance, not only for viral proteases but for other quickly evolving drug targets as well, toward designing inhibitors one step ahead of evolution to counter resistance with more intelligent and rational design.},

Here, we review the challenges of the assembly of polyploid plant genomes, and also present recent advances in genomic resources and functional tools in molecular genetics and breeding. As genomes of diploid and less heterozygous progenitor species are increasingly available, we discuss the lack of complexity of these currently available reference genomes as they relate to polyploid crops. Finally, we review recent approaches of haplotyping by phasing and the impact of third generation technologies on polyploid plant genome assembly.},

First we intend to show the reasons for this interest: implicative links that S.I.A. has pointed out may be interpreted as rules and regulations connecting actions, discourses, …, or as a group's characteristics. We develop some examples showing how S.I.A. can be used and what special research results it can provide. We insist upon some points that may be interesting methodologically to focus on: asymmetric links, nodes and separate implicative ways.},

  abstract     = {Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) contains a circular, viroid-like RNA genome, the only animal viral RNA of its kind. It possesses a ribozyme activity, which can autocatalytically cleave and ligate itself. The ribozyme has a unique structural requirement different from other known ribozymes. HDV RNA undergoes RNA-dependent RNA replication via a double rolling circle mechanism, which is probably mediated by cellular RNA polymerase II, utilizing modified cellular transcription machineries. HDV RNA encodes a single protein, hepatitis delta antigen, which is a nuclear, RNA-binding phosphoprotein and required for viral RNA replication. During replication, HDV RNA undergoes a specific RNA editing event to extend its open reading frame and produce a longer, isoprenylated delta antigen, which suppresses RNA replication and initiates viral particle assembly. Ribozyme, cell-mediated RNA-dependent RNA replication, and RNA editing are some of the unique properties and unresolved issues of the molecular biology of HDV.},

@article{lambVpuVprHuman1997,
  abstract     = {Viral channel-forming proteins comprise a class of viral proteins which, similar to their host companions, are made to alter electrochemical or substrate gradients across lipid membranes. These proteins are active during all stages of the cellular life cycle of viruses. An increasing number of proteins are identified as channel proteins, but the precise role in the viral life cycle is yet unknown for the majority of them. This review presents an overview about these proteins with an emphasis on those with available structural information. A concept is introduced which aligns the transmembrane domains of viral channel proteins with those of host channels and toxins to give insights into the mechanism of function of the viral proteins from potential sequence identities. A summary of to date investigations on drugs targeting these proteins is given and discussed in respect of their mode of action in vivo. The cellular and subcellular membranes encounter an important playground for the activity of membrane proteins encoded by viruses. Viral membrane proteins, similar to their host companions, can be integral or attached to the membrane. They are involved in directing the cellular and viral reproduction, the fusion and budding processes. This review focuses especially on those integral viral membrane proteins which form channels or pores, the classification to be so, modeling by in silico methods and potential drug candidates. The sequence of an isolate of Vpu from HIV-1 is aligned with host ion channels and a toxin. The focus is on the alignment of the transmembrane domains. The results of the alignment are mapped onto the 3D structures of the respective channels and toxin. The results of the mapping support the idea of a ‘channel–pore dualism’ for Vpu. Strictinin, which is a member of the ellagitanin family of hydrolyzable tannins, prevented replication of human, duck and swine influenza A viruses (IAVs) in vitro at non-toxic concentrations. The addition of strictinin at the same time as IAV inoculation to MDCK cells inhibited viral replication in a dose-dependent manner. Strictinin showed 50\% inhibitory concentrations for IAVs from 0.09 ± 0.021 to 0.28 ± 0.037 μM (mean ± S.E.M.) by the focus-forming assay. Treatment of MDCK cells with strictinin before and after viral inoculation resulted in no significant antiviral activity. Further studies showed that strictinin inhibited IAV-induced hemifusion. However, strictinin exhibited no inhibitory effect against receptor binding, sialidase activity. Strictinin also showed an antiviral effect on influenza B virus and human parainfluenza virus type-1 in vitro. The results indicate that strictinin is a useful antiviral agent. Channel-forming proteins are found in a number of viral genomes. In some cases, their role in the viral life cycle is well understood, in some cases it needs still to be elucidated. A common theme is that their mode of action involves a change of electrochemical or proton gradient across the lipid membrane which modulates the viral or cellular activity. Blocking these proteins can be a suitable therapeutic strategy as for some viruses this may be “lethal.” Besides the many biological relevant questions still to be answered, there are also many open questions concerning the biophysical side as well as structural information and the mechanism of function on a molecular level. The immanent biophysical issues are addressed and the work in the field is summarized. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the transmembrane domain (TM) of the Vpu protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) contributes to the pathogenesis of SHIVKU-1bMC33 in macaques and that the TM domain of Vpu could be replaced with the M2 protein viroporin from influenza A virus. Recently, we showed that the replacement of the TM domain of Vpu with that of the M2 protein of influenza A virus resulted in a virus (SHIVM2) that was sensitive to rimantadine [Hout, D.R., Gomez, M.L., Pacyniak, E., Gomez, L.M., Inbody, S.H., Mulcahy, E.R., Culley, N., Pinson, D.M., Powers, M.F., Wong, S.W., Stephens, E.B., 2006. Substitution of the transmembrane domain of Vpu in simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIVKU-1bMC33) with that of M2 of influenza A results in a virus that is sensitive to inhibitors of the M2 ion channel and is pathogenic for pig-tailed macaques. Virology 344, 541–558]. Based on previous studies of the M2 protein which have shown that the His–X–X–X–Trp motif within the M2 is essential to the function of the M2 proton channel, we have constructed a novel SHIV in which the alanine at position 19 of the TM domain was replaced with a histidine residue resulting in the motif His–Ile–Leu–Val–Trp. The SHIVVpuA19H replicated with similar kinetics as the parental SHIVKU-1bMC33 and pulse-chase analysis revealed that the processing of viral proteins was similar to SHIVKU-1bMC33. This SHIVVpuA19H virus was found to be more sensitive to the M2 ion channel blocker rimantadine than SHIVM2. Electron microscopic examination of SHIVVpuA19H-infected cells treated with rimantadine revealed an accumulation of viral particles at the cell surface and within intracellular vesicles, which was similar to that previously observed to SHIVM2-infected cells treated with rimantadine. These data indicate that the Vpu protein of HIV-1 can be converted into a rimantadine-sensitive ion channel with the alteration of one amino acid and provide additional evidence that drugs targeting the Vpu TM/ion channel can be effective anti-HIV-1 drugs. The Vpu protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 has been shown to shunt the CD4 receptor molecule to the proteasome for degradation and to enhance virus release from infected cells. The exact mechanism by which the Vpu protein enhances virus release is currently unknown but some investigators have shown that this function is associated with the transmembrane domain and potential ion channel properties. In this study, we determined if the transmembrane domain of Vpu could be functionally substituted with that of the prototypical viroporin, the M2 protein of influenza A virus. We constructed chimeric vpu gene in which the transmembrane domain of Vpu was replaced with that of the M2 protein of influenza. This chimeric vpu gene was substituted for the vpu gene in the genome of a pathogenic simian human immunodeficiency virus, SHIVKU-1bMC33. The resulting virus, SHIVM2, synthesized a Vpu protein that had a slightly different Mr compared to the parental SHIVKU-1bMC33, reflecting the different sizes of the two Vpu proteins. The SHIVM2 was shown to replicate with slightly reduced kinetics when compared to the parental SHIVKU-1bMC33 but electron microscopy revealed that the site of maturation was similar to the parental virus SHIVKU1bMC33. We show that the replication and spread of SHIVM2 could be blocked with the antiviral drug rimantadine, which is known to target the M2 ion channel. Our results indicate a dose dependent inhibition of SHIVM2 with 100 μM rimantadine resulting in a {$>$}95\% decrease in p27 released into the culture medium. Rimantadine did not affect the replication of the parental SHIVKU-1bMC33. Examination of SHIVM2-infected cells treated with 50 μM rimantadine revealed numerous viral particles associated with the cell plasma membrane and within intracytoplasmic vesicles, which is similar to HIV-1 mutants lacking a functional vpu. To determine if SHIVM2 was as pathogenic as the parental SHIVKU-1bMC33 virus, two pig-tailed macaques were inoculated and followed for up to 8 months. Both pig-tailed macaques developed severe CD4+ T cell loss within 1 month of inoculation, high viral loads, and histological lesions consistent with lymphoid depletion similar to the parental SHIVKU-1bMC33. Taken together, these results indicate for the first time that the TM domain of the Vpu protein can be functionally substituted with the TM of M2 of influenza A virus, and shows that compounds that target the TM domain of Vpu protein of HIV-1 could serve as novel anti-HIV-1 drugs.},

@article{lamCompressedIndexingLocal2008,
  abstract     = {Motivation: Recent experimental studies on compressed indexes (BWT, CSA, FM-index) have confirmed their practicality for indexing very long strings such as the human genome in the main memory. For example, a BWT index for the human genome (with about 3 billion characters) occupies just around 1 G bytes. However, these indexes are designed for exact pattern matching, which is too stringent for biological applications. The demand is often on finding local alignments (pairs of similar substrings with gaps allowed). Without indexing, one can use dynamic programming to find all the local alignments between a text T and a pattern P in O(|T||P|) time, but this would be too slow when the text is of genome scale (e.g. aligning a gene with the human genome would take tens to hundreds of hours). In practice, biologists use heuristic-based software such as BLAST, which is very efficient but does not guarantee to find all local alignments.Results: In this article, we show how to build a software called BWT-SW that exploits a BWT index of a text T to speed up the dynamic programming for finding all local alignments. Experiments reveal that BWT-SW is very efficient (e.g. aligning a pattern of length 3 000 with the human genome takes less than a minute). We have also analyzed BWT-SW mathematically for a simpler similarity model (with gaps disallowed), and we show that the expected running time is O(|T|0.628|P|) for random strings. As far as we know, BWT-SW is the first practical tool that can find all local alignments. Yet BWT-SW is not meant to be a replacement of BLAST, as BLAST is still several times faster than BWT-SW for long patterns and BLAST is indeed accurate enough in most cases (we have used BWT-SW to check against the accuracy of BLAST and found that only rarely BLAST would miss some significant alignments).Availability:www.cs.hku.hk/\textasciitilde ckwong3/bwtswContact:twlam@cs.hku.hk},

Most were sequential isolates obtained at the initiation of and during therapy. Comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of the reverse transcriptase (RT) coding region from five pairs of sensitive and resistant isolates identified three predicted amino acid substitutions common to all the resistant strains (Asp67----Asn, Lys70----Arg, Thr215----Phe or Tyr) plus a fourth in three isolates (Lys219----Gln). Partially resistant isolates had combinations of these four changes. An infectious molecular clone constructed with these four mutations in RT yielded highly resistant HIV after transfection of T cells. The reproducible nature of these mutations should make it possible to develop rapid assays to predict zidovudine resistance by performing polymerase chain reaction amplification of nucleic acid from peripheral blood lymphocytes, thereby circumventing current lengthy HIV isolation and sensitivity testing.},

  abstract     = {One of the major characteristics of HIV-1 is its high genetic variability and extensive heterogeneity. This characteristic is due to its molecular traits, which in turn allows it to vary, recombine, and diversify at a high frequency. As such, it generates complex molecular forms, termed recombinants, which evade the human immune system and so survive. There is no sequence constraint to the recombination pattern as it appears to occur at inter-group (between groups M and O), as well as interand intra-subtype within group M. Rapid emergence and active global transmission of HIV-1 recombinants, known as circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs), requires urgent attention. To date, 55 CRFs have been reported around the world. The first CRF01\_AE originated from Central Africa but spread widely in Asia. The most recent CRF; CRF55\_01B is a recombinant form of CRF01\_AE and subtype B, although its origin is yet to be publicly disclosed. HIV-1 recombination is an ongoing event and plays an indispensable role in HIV epidemics in different regions. Africa, Asia and South America are identified as recombination hot-spots. They are affected by continual emergence and cocirculation of newly emerging CRFs and URFs, which are now responsible for almost 20\% of HIV-1 infections worldwide. Better understanding of recombinants is necessary to determine their biological and molecular attributes.},

@article{lebreCombinatoricsOverlappingGenes2017,
  abstract     = {Overlapping genes exist in all domains of life and are much more abundant than expected upon their first discovery in the late 1970s. Assuming that the reference gene is read in frame +0, an overlapping gene can be encoded in two reading frames in the sense strand, denoted by +1 and +2, and in three reading frames in the opposite strand, denoted by −0, −1, and −2. This motivated numerous researchers to study the constraints induced by the genetic code on the various overlapping frames, mostly based on information theory. Our focus in this paper is on the constraints induced on two overlapping genes in terms of amino acids, as well as polypeptides. We show that simple linear constraints bind the amino-acid composition of two proteins encoded by overlapping genes. Novel constraints are revealed when polypeptides are considered, and not just single amino acids. For example, in double-coding sequences with an overlapping reading frame −2, each Tyrosine (denoted as Tyr or Y) in the overlapping frame overlaps a Tyrosine in the reference frame +0 (and reciprocally), whereas specific words (e.g. YY) never occur. We thus distinguish between null constraints (YY = 0 in frame −2) and non-null constraints (Y in frame +0 ⇔ Y in frame −2). Our equivalence-based constraints are symmetrical and thus enable the characterization of the joint composition of overlapping proteins. We describe several formal frameworks and a graph algorithm to characterize and compute these constraints. As expected, the degrees of freedom left by these constraints vary drastically among the different overlapping frames. Interestingly, the biological meaning of constraints induced on two overlapping proteins (hydropathy, forbidden di-peptides, expected overlap length …) is also specific to the reading frame. We study the combinatorics of these constraints for overlapping polypeptides of length n, pointing out that, (i) except for frame −2, non-null constraints are deduced from the amino-acid (length = 1) constraints and (ii) null constraints are deduced from the di-peptide (length = 2) constraints. These results yield support for understanding the mechanisms and evolution of overlapping genes, and for developing novel overlapping gene detection methods.},

A single network learns the entire recognition operation, going from the normalized image of the character to the final classification.},

  abstract     = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

Robust prediction of miRNA-mRNA pairs is of utmost importance in deciphering gene regulation but has been challenging because of high false positive rates, despite a deluge of computational tools that normally require laborious manual feature extraction. This paper presents an end-to-end machine learning framework for miRNA target prediction. Leveraged by deep recurrent neural networks-based auto-encoding and sequence-sequence interaction learning, our approach not only delivers an unprecedented level of accuracy but also eliminates the need for manual feature extraction. The performance gap between the proposed method and existing alternatives is substantial (over 25\% increase in F-measure), and deepTarget delivers a quantum leap in the longstanding challenge of robust miRNA target prediction.

  abstract     = {Motivation: Genome resequencing and short read mapping are two of the primary tools of genomics and are used for many important applications. The current state-of-the-art in mapping uses the quality values and mapping quality scores to evaluate the reliability of the mapping. These attributes, however, are assigned to individual reads and do not directly measure the problematic repeats across the genome. Here, we present the Genome Mappability Score (GMS) as a novel measure of the complexity of resequencing a genome. The GMS is a weighted probability that any read could be unambiguously mapped to a given position and thus measures the overall composition of the genome itself.Results: We have developed the Genome Mappability Analyzer to compute the GMS of every position in a genome. It leverages the parallelism of cloud computing to analyze large genomes, and enabled us to identify the 5–14\% of the human, mouse, fly and yeast genomes that are difficult to analyze with short reads. We examined the accuracy of the widely used BWA/SAMtools polymorphism discovery pipeline in the context of the GMS, and found discovery errors are dominated by false negatives, especially in regions with poor GMS. These errors are fundamental to the mapping process and cannot be overcome by increasing coverage. As such, the GMS should be considered in every resequencing project to pinpoint the ‘dark matter’ of the genome, including of known clinically relevant variations in these regions.Availability: The source code and profiles of several model organisms are available at http://gma-bio.sourceforge.netContact:hlee@cshl.eduSupplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract     = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a trending new standard for genotypic HIV-1 drug resistance (HIVDR) testing. Many NGS HIVDR data analysis pipelines have been independently developed, each with variable outputs and data management protocols. Standardization of such analytical methods and comparison of available pipelines are lacking, yet may impact subsequent HIVDR interpretation and other downstream applications. Here we compared the performance of five NGS HIVDR pipelines using proficiency panel samples from NIAID Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) program. Ten VQA panel specimens were genotyped by each of six international laboratories using their own in-house NGS assays. Raw NGS data were then processed using each of the five different pipelines including HyDRA, MiCall, PASeq, Hivmmer and DEEPGEN. All pipelines detected amino acid variants (AAVs) at full range of frequencies (1\textasciitilde 100\%) and demonstrated good linearity as compared to the reference frequency values. While the sensitivity in detecting low abundance AAVs, with frequencies between 1\textasciitilde 20\%, is less a concern for all pipelines, their specificity dramatically decreased at AAV frequencies {$<$}2\%, suggesting that 2\% threshold may be a more reliable reporting threshold for ensured specificity in AAV calling and reporting. More variations were observed among the pipelines when low abundance AAVs are concerned, likely due to differences in their NGS read quality control strategies. Findings from this study highlight the need for standardized strategies for NGS HIVDR data analysis, especially for the detection of minority HIVDR variants.},

In the ensuing decades, research focused on discovering and eliminating viral threats to plant and animal health. However, recent conceptual and methodological revolutions have made it clear that viruses are not merely agents of destruction but essential components of global ecosystems. As plants make up over 80\% of the biomass on Earth, plant viruses likely have a larger impact on ecosystem stability and function than viruses of other kingdoms. Besides preventing overgrowth of genetically homogeneous plant populations such as crop plants, some plant viruses might also promote the adaptation of their hosts to changing environments. However, estimates of the extent and frequencies of such mutualistic interactions remain controversial. In this Review, we focus on the origins of plant viruses and the evolution of interactions between these viruses and both their hosts and transmission vectors. We also identify currently unknown aspects of plant virus ecology and evolution that are of practical importance and that should be resolvable in the near future through viral metagenomics.},

As the overall quality of an association rule set can be considered as insight of the studied domain given to the decider by the interpretation of the rules, too many rules can make an harder interpretation then a worse quality of the overall process.To get more readable rules and thus improve this global quality criterion, we apply techniques initially designed for redundancy reduction in functional dependencies sets to association rules. Although the two kinds of relations have different properties, this method allow very concise representations that are easily understood by the decider and can be further exploited for automatic reasoning.sIn this paper, we present this method, compare it to other approaches and apply it to synthetic datasets.

  abstract     = {Amino acid replacement matrices are an essential basis of protein phylogenetics. They are used to compute substitution probabilities along phylogeny branches and thus the likelihood of the data. They are also essential in protein alignment. A number of replacement matrices and methods to estimate these matrices from protein alignments have been proposed since the seminal work of Dayhoff et al. (1972). An important advance was achieved by Whelan and Goldman (2001) and their WAG matrix, thanks to an efficient maximum likelihood estimation approach that accounts for the phylogenies of sequences within each training alignment. We further refine this method by incorporating the variability of evolutionary rates across sites in the matrix estimation and using a much larger and diverse database than BRKALN, which was used to estimate WAG. To estimate our new matrix (called LG after the authors), we use an adaptation of the XRATE software and 3,912 alignments from Pfam, comprising ∼50,000 sequences and ∼6.5 million residues overall. To evaluate the LG performance, we use an independent sample consisting of 59 alignments from TreeBase and randomly divide Pfam alignments into 3,412 training and 500 test alignments. The comparison with WAG and JTT shows a clear likelihood improvement. With TreeBase, we find that 1) the average Akaike information criterion gain per site is 0.25 and 0.42, when compared with WAG and JTT, respectively; 2) LG is significantly better than WAG for 38 alignments (among 59), and significantly worse with 2 alignments only; and 3) tree topologies inferred with LG, WAG, and JTT frequently differ, indicating that using LG impacts not only the likelihood value but also the output tree. Results with the test alignments from Pfam are analogous. LG and a PHYML implementation can be downloaded from http://atgc.lirmm.fr/LG.},

Until the end of February 2020, the number of available genomes was below 1,000, and their multiple alignment was easily achieved using standard approaches. Subsequently, the availability of genomes has grown dramatically. Moreover, some genomes are of low quality with sequencing/assembly errors, making accurate re-alignment of all genomes nearly impossible on a daily basis. A more efficient, yet accurate approach was clearly required to pursue all subsequent bioinformatics analyses of this crucial data.hCoV-19 genomes are highly conserved, with very few indels and no recombination. This makes the profile HMM approach particularly well suited to align new genomes, add them to an existing alignment and filter problematic ones. Using a core of ∼2,500 high quality genomes, we estimated a profile using HMMER, and implemented this profile in COVID-Align, a user-friendly interface to be used online or as standalone via Docker. The alignment of 1,000 genomes requires ∼50mn on our cluster. Moreover, COVID-Align provides summary statistics, which can be used to determine the sequencing quality and evolutionary novelty of input genomes (e.g. number of new mutations and indels).https://covalign.pasteur.cloud, hub.docker.com/r/evolbioinfo/covid-alignSupplementary information is available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{lewisEpisodicSexualTransmission2008,
  abstract     = {Background The structure of sexual contact networks plays a key role in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections, and their reconstruction from interview data has provided valuable insights into the spread of infection. For HIV, the long period of infectivity has made the interpretation of contact networks more difficult, and major discrepancies have been observed between the contact network and the transmission network revealed by viral phylogenetics. The high rate of HIV evolution in principle allows for detailed reconstruction of links between virus from different individuals, but often sampling has been too sparse to describe the structure of the transmission network. The aim of this study was to analyze a high-density sample of an HIV-infected population using recently developed techniques in phylogenetics to infer the short-term dynamics of the epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods and Findings Sequences of the protease and reverse transcriptase coding regions from 2,126 patients, predominantly MSM, from London were compared: 402 of these showed a close match to at least one other subtype B sequence. Nine large clusters were identified on the basis of genetic distance; all were confirmed by Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) phylogenetic analysis. Overall, 25\% of individuals with a close match with one sequence are linked to 10 or more others. Dated phylogenies of the clusters using a relaxed clock indicated that 65\% of the transmissions within clusters took place between 1995 and 2000, and 25\% occurred within 6 mo after infection. The likelihood that not all members of the clusters have been identified renders the latter observation conservative. Conclusions Reconstruction of the HIV transmission network using a dated phylogeny approach has revealed the HIV epidemic among MSM in London to have been episodic, with evidence of multiple clusters of transmissions dating to the late 1990s, a period when HIV prevalence is known to have doubled in this population. The quantitative description of the transmission dynamics among MSM will be important for parameterization of epidemiological models and in designing intervention strategies.},

A very successful means of inferring the structure or function of a previously unannotated protein is via sequence similarity with one or more proteins whose structure or function is already known. Toward this end, we propose a means of representing proteins using pairwise sequence similarity scores. This representation, combined with a discriminative classification algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM), provides a powerful means of detecting subtle structural and evolutionary relationships among proteins. The algorithm, called SVM-pairwise, when tested on its ability to recognize previously unseen families from the SCOP database, yields significantly better performance than SVM-Fisher, profile HMMs, and PSI-BLAST.},

  abstract     = {Motivation: Many programs for aligning short sequencing reads to a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years. Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads \&gt;200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashing-based software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time.Results: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as SSAHA2, more accurate than BLAT, and is several to tens of times faster than both.Availability:http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.netContact:rd@sanger.ac.uk},

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows–Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10–20× faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.Availability:http://maq.sourceforge.netContact:rd@sanger.ac.uk},

However this technology is currently hindered by high error rates in the output data that affect analyses such as the identification of isoforms, exon boundaries, open reading frames and creation of gene catalogues. Due to the novelty of such data, computational methods are still actively being developed and options for the error correction of Nanopore RNA-sequencing long reads remain limited.In this article, we evaluate the extent to which existing long-read DNA error correction methods are capable of correcting cDNA Nanopore reads. We provide an automatic and extensive benchmark tool that not only reports classical error correction metrics but also the effect of correction on gene families, isoform diversity, bias toward the major isoform and splice site detection. We find that long read error correction tools that were originally developed for DNA are also suitable for the correction of Nanopore RNA-sequencing data, especially in terms of increasing base pair accuracy. Yet investigators should be warned that the correction process perturbs gene family sizes and isoform diversity. This work provides guidelines on which (or whether) error correction tools should be used, depending on the application type.https://gitlab.com/leoisl/LR\_EC\_analyser},

  abstract     = {New sequencing technologies promise a new era in the use of DNA sequence. However, some of these technologies produce very short reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence of a diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes full use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and an empirical model for correlated errors at a site. Both read mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on simulated data and real data. MAQ is accurate, efficient, versatile, and user-friendly. It is freely available at http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in sequencing technologies promise ultra-long reads of ∼100 kb in average, full-length mRNA or cDNA reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in length. Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which presses for the development of new alignment algorithms.Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of ≥100\,bp in length, ≥1\,kb genomic reads at error rate ∼15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3–4 times as fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is ≥30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.https://github.com/lh3/minimap2Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

However, at present, long reads have an error rate as high as 10–15\%. Complex and computationally intensive pipelines are required to assemble such reads.Results: We present a new mapper, minimap and a de novo assembler, miniasm, for efficiently mapping and assembling SMRT and ONT reads without an error correction stage. They can often assemble a sequencing run of bacterial data into a single contig in a few minutes, and assemble 45-fold Caenorhabditis elegans data in 9\,min, orders of magnitude faster than the existing pipelines, though the consensus sequence error rate is as high as raw reads.

@article{linKartDivideandconquerAlgorithm2017,
  abstract     = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides a great opportunity to investigate genome-wide variation at nucleotide resolution. Due to the huge amount of data, NGS applications require very fast and accurate alignment algorithms. Most existing algorithms for read mapping basically adopt seed-and-extend strategy, which is sequential in nature and takes much longer time on longer reads. RESULTS: We develop a divide-and-conquer algorithm, called Kart, which can process long reads as fast as short reads by dividing a read into small fragments that can be aligned independently. Our experiment result indicates that the average size of fragments requiring the more time-consuming gapped alignment is around 20\,bp regardless of the original read length. Furthermore, it can tolerate much higher error rates. The experiments show that Kart spends much less time on longer reads than other aligners and still produce reliable alignments even when the error rate is as high as 15\%.

@article{lipmanRapidSensitiveProtein1985,
  abstract     = {An algorithm was developed which facilitates the search for similarities between newly determined amino acid sequences and sequences already available in databases. Because of the algorithm's efficiency on many microcomputers, sensitive protein database searches may now become a routine procedure for molecular biologists. The method efficiently identifies regions of similar sequence and then scores the aligned identical and differing residues in those regions by means of an amino acid replacability matrix. This matrix increases sensitivity by giving high scores to those amino acid replacements which occur frequently in evolution. The algorithm has been implemented in a computer program designed to search protein databases very rapidly. For example, comparison of a 200-amino-acid sequence to the 500,000 residues in the National Biomedical Research Foundation library would take less than 2 minutes on a minicomputer, and less than 10 minutes on a microcomputer (IBM PC).},

@article{liPredictionProteinStructural2008,
  abstract     = {A prior knowledge of protein structural classes can provide useful information about its overall structure, so it is very important for quick and accurate determination of protein structural class with computation method in protein science. One of the key for computation method is accurate protein sample representation. Here, based on the concept of Chou’s pseudo-amino acid composition (AAC, Chou, Proteins: structure, function, and genetics, 43:246–255, 2001), a novel method of feature extraction that combined continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with principal component analysis (PCA) was introduced for the prediction of protein structural classes. Firstly, the digital signal was obtained by mapping each amino acid according to various physicochemical properties. Secondly, CWT was utilized to extract new feature vector based on wavelet power spectrum (WPS), which contains more abundant information of sequence order in frequency domain and time domain, and PCA was then used to reorganize the feature vector to decrease information redundancy and computational complexity. Finally, a pseudo-amino acid composition feature vector was further formed to represent primary sequence by coupling AAC vector with a set of new feature vector of WPS in an orthogonal space by PCA. As a showcase, the rigorous jackknife cross-validation test was performed on the working datasets. The results indicated that prediction quality has been improved, and the current approach of protein representation may serve as a useful complementary vehicle in classifying other attributes of proteins, such as enzyme family class, subcellular localization, membrane protein types and protein secondary structure, etc.},

  abstract      = {As high-throughput biological sequencing becomes faster and cheaper, the need to extract useful information from sequencing becomes ever more paramount, often limited by low-throughput experimental characterizations. For proteins, accurate prediction of their functions directly from their primary amino-acid sequences has been a long standing challenge. Here, machine learning using artificial recurrent neural networks (RNN) was applied towards classification of protein function directly from primary sequence without sequence alignment, heuristic scoring or feature engineering. The RNN models containing long-short-term-memory (LSTM) units trained on public, annotated datasets from UniProt achieved high performance for in-class prediction of four important protein functions tested, particularly compared to other machine learning algorithms using sequence-derived protein features. RNN models were used also for out-of-class predictions of phylogenetically distinct protein families with similar functions, including proteins of the CRISPR-associated nuclease, ferritin-like iron storage and cytochrome P450 families. Applying the trained RNN models on the partially unannotated UniRef100 database predicted not only candidates validated by existing annotations but also currently unannotated sequences. Some RNN predictions for the ferritin-like iron sequestering function were experimentally validated, even though their sequences differ significantly from known, characterized proteins and from each other and cannot be easily predicted using popular bioinformatics methods. As sequencing and experimental characterization data increases rapidly, the machine-learning approach based on RNN could be useful for discovery and prediction of homologues for a wide range of protein functions.},

  abstract  = {Protein sequence alignment is a key component of most bioinformatics pipelines to study the structures and functions of proteins. Aligning highly divergent sequences remains, however, a difficult task that current algorithms often fail to perform accurately, leaving many proteins or open reading frames poorly annotated. Here, we leverage recent advances in deep learning for language modelling and differentiable programming to propose DEDAL, a flexible model to align protein sequences and detect homologs. DEDAL is a machine learning-based model that learns to align sequences by observing large datasets of raw protein sequences and of correct alignments. Once trained, we show that DEDAL improves by up to two- or three-fold the alignment correctness over existing methods on remote homologs, and better discriminates remote homologs from evolutionarily unrelated sequences, paving the way to improvements on many downstream tasks relying on sequence alignment in structural and functional genomics.},

@article{lloydHighCostFidelity2014,
  abstract     = {The notoriously low fidelity of HIV-1 replication is largely responsible for the virus's rapid mutation rate, facilitating escape from immune or drug control. The error-prone activity of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) is predicted to be the most influential mechanism for generating mutations. The low fidelity of RT has been successfully exploited by nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) that halt viral replication upon incorporation. Consequently, drug-resistant strains have arisen in which the viral RT has an increased fidelity of replication, thus reducing analogue incorporation. Higher fidelity, however, impacts on viral fitness. The appearance of compensatory mutations in combination with higher fidelity NRTI resistance mutations and the subsequent reversion of NRTI-resistant mutations upon cessation of antiretroviral treatment lend support to the notion that higher fidelity exacts a fitness cost. Potential mechanisms for reduced viral fitness are a smaller pool of mutant strains available to respond to immune or drug pressure, slower rates of replication, and a limitation to the dNTP tropism of the virus. Unraveling the relationship between replication fidelity and fitness should lead to a greater understanding of the evolution and control of HIV.},

The algorithm maps a sequence to 2-dimensional space, while an extension of the CGR, the so-called frequency matrix representation (FCGR), transforms sequences of different lengths into equal-sized images or matrices. The CGR is a generalized Markov chain and includes various properties, which allow a unique representation of a sequence. Therefore, it has a broad spectrum of applications in bioinformatics, such as sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis and as an encoding of sequences for machine learning.

  abstract     = {Classification of protein sequences is one big task in bioinformatics and has many applications. Different machine learning methods exist and are applied on these problems, such as support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF) and neural networks (NN). All of these methods have in common that protein sequences have to be made machine-readable and comparable in the first step, for which different encodings exist. These encodings are typically based on physical or chemical properties of the sequence. However, due to the outstanding performance of deep neural networks (DNN) on image recognition, we used frequency matrix chaos game representation (FCGR) for encoding of protein sequences into images. In this study, we compare the performance of SVMs, RFs and DNNs, trained on FCGR encoded protein sequences. While the original chaos game representation (CGR) has been used mainly for genome sequence encoding and classification, we modified it to work also for protein sequences, resulting in n-flakes representation, an image with several icosagons.We could show that all applied machine learning techniques (RF, SVM and DNN) show promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark datasets, with DNNs outperforming the other methods and that FCGR is a promising new encoding method for protein sequences.https://cran.r-project.org/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge to the characterization of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are widespread in the proteome, but relatively poorly understood, is the identification of molecular features that mediate functions of these regions, such as short motifs, amino acid repeats and physicochemical properties. Here, we introduce a proteome-scale feature discovery approach for IDRs. Our approach, which we call “reverse homology”, exploits the principle that important functional features are conserved over evolution. We use this as a contrastive learning signal for deep learning: given a set of homologous IDRs, the neural network has to correctly choose a held-out homolog from another set of IDRs sampled randomly from the proteome. We pair reverse homology with a simple architecture and standard interpretation techniques, and show that the network learns conserved features of IDRs that can be interpreted as motifs, repeats, or bulk features like charge or amino acid propensities. We also show that our model can be used to produce visualizations of what residues and regions are most important to IDR function, generating hypotheses for uncharacterized IDRs. Our results suggest that feature discovery using unsupervised neural networks is a promising avenue to gain systematic insight into poorly understood protein sequences.},

Although a number of approaches have been proposed for shock graph matching, these approaches do not address the equally important indexing problem. We extend our previous work in both shock graph matching and hierarchical structure indexing to propose the first unified framework for view-based 3-D object recognition using shock graphs. The heart of the framework is an improved spectral characterization of shock graph structure that not only drives a powerful indexing mechanism (to retrieve similar candidates from a large database), but also drives a matching algorithm that can accommodate noise and occlusion. We describe the components of our system and evaluate its performance using both unoccluded and occluded queries. The large set of recognition trials (over 25,000) from a large database (over 1400 views) represents one of the most ambitious shock graph-based recognition experiments conducted to date.

A variable number of integrase molecules congregate on viral DNA ends to assemble a conserved intasome core machine that facilitates integration. The structures additionally informed on the modes of integrase inhibitor action and the means by which HIV acquires drug resistance. Recent years have witnessed the development of allosteric integrase inhibitors, a highly promising class of small molecules that antagonize viral morphogenesis. In this Review, we explore recent insights into the organization and mechanism of the retroviral integration machinery and highlight open questions as well as new directions in the field.},

  abstract     = {A new and conceptually simple data structure, called a suffix array, for on-line string searches is introduced in this paper. Constructing and querying suffix arrays is reduced to a sort and search paradigm that employs novel algorithms. The main advantage of suffix arrays over suffix trees is that, in practice, they use three to five times less space. From a complexity standpoint, suffix arrays permit on-line string searches of the type, “Is W a substring of A?” to be answered in time  𝑂(𝑃+log𝑁) O(P+log⁡N) , where P is the length of W and N is the length of A, which is competitive with (and in some cases slightly better than) suffix trees. The only drawback is that in those instances where the underlying alphabet is finite and small, suffix trees can be constructed in  𝑂(𝑁) O(N)  time in the worst case, versus  𝑂(𝑁log𝑁) O(Nlog⁡N)  time for suffix arrays. However, an augmented algorithm is given that, regardless of the alphabet size, constructs suffix arrays in  𝑂(𝑁) O(N) expected time, albeit with lesser space efficiency. It is believed that suffix arrays will prove to be better in practice than suffix trees for many applications.},

@article{mangasarianMultifacetedRoleHIV1997,
  abstract     = {Relatively small genomes and high replication rates allow viruses and bacteria to accumulate mutations. This continuously presents the host immune system with new challenges. On the other side of the trenches, an increasingly well‐adjusted host immune response, shaped by coevolutionary history, makes a pathogen's life a rather complicated endeavor. It is, therefore, no surprise that pathogens either escape detection or modulate the host immune response, often by redirecting normal cellular pathways to their advantage. For the purpose of this chapter, we focus mainly on the manipulation of the class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen presentation pathways and the ubiquitin (Ub)‐proteasome system by both viral and bacterial pathogens. First, we describe the general features of antigen presentation pathways and the Ub‐proteasome system and then address how they are manipulated by pathogens. We discuss the many human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)‐encoded immunomodulatory genes that interfere with antigen presentation (immunoevasins) and focus on the HCMV immunoevasins US2 and US11, which induce the degradation of class I MHC heavy chains by the proteasome by catalyzing their export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)‐membrane into the cytosol, a process termed ER dislocation. US2‐ and US11‐mediated subversion of ER dislocation ensures proteasomal degradation of class I MHC molecules and presumably allows HCMV to avoid recognition by cytotoxic T cells, whilst providing insight into general aspects of ER‐associated degradation (ERAD) which is used by eukaryotic cells to purge their ER of defective proteins. We discuss the similarities and differences between the distinct pathways co‐opted by US2 and US11 for dislocation and degradation of human class I MHC molecules and also a putatively distinct pathway utilized by the murine herpes virus (MHV)‐68 mK3 immunoevasin for ER dislocation of murine class I MHC. We speculate on the implications of the three pathogen‐exploited dislocation pathways to cellular ER quality control. Moreover, we discuss the ubiquitin (Ub)‐proteasome system and its position at the core of antigen presentation as proteolysis and intracellular trafficking rely heavily on Ub‐dependent processes. We add a few examples of manipulation of the Ub‐proteasome system by pathogens in the context of the immune system and such diverse aspects of the host–pathogen relationship as virus budding, bacterial chromosome integration, and programmed cell death, to name a few. Finally, we speculate on newly found pathogen‐encoded deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and their putative roles in modulation of host–pathogen interactions. Background: The HIV Nef protein downregulates CD4 through sequential connection with clathrin-coated pits and the COP1 coatomer, resulting in accelerated endocytosis and lysosomal targeting. Results: Here we report that the small GTPase ARF1 controls the Nef-induced, COP-mediated late-endosomal targeting of CD4. We find that Nef binds ARF1 directly and can recruit the GTPase onto endosomal membranes. Furthermore, a complex comprising Nef, ARF1, and βCOP can be immunoprecipitated from cells expressing the viral protein. Residues in a C-terminal loop of the viral protein facilitate both these interactions and the targeting of Nef and CD4 to acidic late endosomes, whereas other residues primarily involved in mediating CD4 endocytosis are dispensable for this process. Finally, a dominant-negative ARF1 mutant blocks the migration of the Nef-CD4 complex to lysosomes. Conclusions: Our results support a model in which ARF1 is the immediate downstream partner of Nef for CD4 lysosomal targeting. Major histocompatibility complex class II HLA-DR molecules are plasma-membrane integral heterodimers, constitutively expressed in antigen-presenting cells. Their expression is known to be upregulated in peripheral T lymphocytes upon cell activation and to be constitutive in T cell lines. In H78-C10.0, a subclone of the human CD4+ T cell line HUT-78, the transport of MHC class II HLA-DR molecules is blocked, resulting in their localization within internal vesicular compartments rather than at the cell surface. In this article, we show that HIV-1HX10 infection of H78-C10.0 cells induces HLA-DR surface expression. Moreover, the produced infectious viruses harbor the heterodimer molecules in their envelopes. To define which of the viral proteins was involved in this phenomenon, we infected H78-C10.0 cells with recombinant vaccinia vectors containing either the gag-pro coding sequence or the entire env gene. Only gag expression was able to induce HLA-DR cell-surface localization in H78-C10.0 cells. RT-PCR analysis of the infected cells revealed no significant alteration in the amount of HLA-DRα-specific RNA compared to untreated cells. This implies that Gag acts on downstream events. When the env viral gene, coding for the precursor glycoprotein gp160, was expressed in H78-C10.0, the Env protein targeted to the cell surface was poorly processed to its final mature forms gp120 and gp41. However, coexpression of the env and gag genes led to restoration of this phenotype. Although the mechanism is unknown, the data compiled in this study strongly suggest that the viral Gag protein can interact with the cellular trafficking apparatus. Moreover, in a specific cell type as H78-C10.0 this interaction can even reverse intracellular transport defects. Defective deletion mutants can be replicated in superinfected cells by parasitism of the intact virus' replication machinery, and through replication with the host cell. We show by analysis of a mathematical model that dynamic stability of superinfected cell growth is crucial in determining the frequency of deletion mutant infected cells, i.e. there is a critical infectivity threshold ρscbelow which the density of proliferative virus is significantly reduced by the presence of defective deletion mutants. Above ρsc, proliferative virus principally occurs as superinfected cells (wild type with defective deletion mutant). The thresholdρsc , and the interference effects of the deletion mutant, increase with deletion mutant parasitism of the wild-type replication machinery in superinfected cells. The interaction of virally infected cells with host homeostasis determines whether immune escape by deletion mutant infected cells is necessary for the interference window to exist. Only when the deletion mutant has a detrimental effect on infected host cell replication did we observe periodic behaviour. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genome encodes a total of three structural proteins, two envelope proteins, three enzymes, and six accessory proteins. Studies over the past ten years have provided high-resolution three-dimensional structural information for all of the viral enzymes, structural proteins and envelope proteins, as well as for three of the accessory proteins. In some cases it has been possible to solve the structures of the intact, native proteins, but in most cases structural data were obtained for isolated protein domains, peptidic fragments, or mutants. Peptide complexes with two regulatory RNA fragments and a protein complex with an RNA recognition/encapsidation element have also been structurally characterized. This article summarizes the high-resolution structural information that is currently available for HIV proteins and reviews current structure-function and structure-biological relationships. Simian immunodeficiency virus strain PBj14, SIVsmmPBj14, is unique among primate lentiviruses in its ability to trigger the proliferation of resting simian lymphocytes and to cause the rapid death of experimentally inoculated pigtailed macaques. Severe enteropathy, immune activation, and extensive apoptosis, particularly within gut-associated lymphoid tissue, characterize the acute disease syndrome associated with SIVsmmPBj14infection. In the present study, we examined whether the ability of this virus to cause widespread apoptosis might be linked to the up-regulation of Fas ligand (CD95L) expression in virally infected cells.In vitrostudies revealed that expression of the viral Nef protein, in the absence of any other viral gene product, was sufficient to up-regulate the transcriptional activity of the CD95L promoter and to cause cell surface expression of Fas ligand. This up-regulation was NFAT dependent (inhibited by cyclosporin A) and did not occur in cells that expressed a mutated derivative of the viral Nef protein, lacking a previously defined immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. These findings were corroborated by analysis of tissue sections from virally infected macaques. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that Fas ligand expression was efficiently up-regulated in the GALT of animals that had been experimentally infected with wild-type SIVsmmPBj14but not in animals that were infected with a nonacutely pathogenic viral mutant lacking the Nef ITAM. Taken together, these results suggest that the ability of SIVsmmPBj14to cause acutely lethal disease and to up-regulate FasL expression may be linked. Additional studies will be required to determine whether the induction of FasL expression is in itself important for acute disease pathogenesis.},

However, the short read lengths of currently used sequencing approaches pose a limitation for the identification of structural variants, sequencing repetitive regions, phasing of alleles and distinguishing highly homologous genomic regions. These limitations may significantly contribute to the diagnostic gap in patients with genetic disorders who have undergone standard NGS, like whole exome or even genome sequencing. Now, the emerging long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies may offer improvements in the characterization of genetic variation and regions that are difficult to assess with the prevailing NGS approaches. LRS has so far mainly been used to investigate genetic disorders with previously known or strongly suspected disease loci. While these targeted approaches already show the potential of LRS, it remains to be seen whether LRS technologies can soon enable true whole genome sequencing routinely. Ultimately, this could allow the de novo assembly of individual whole genomes used as a generic test for genetic disorders. In this article, we summarize the current LRS-based research on human genetic disorders and discuss the potential of these technologies to facilitate the next major advancements in medical genetics.},

@article{marcaisImprovingPerformanceMinimizers2017,
  abstract     = {Motivation The minimizers scheme is a method for selecting k-mers from sequences. It is used in many bioinformatics software tools to bin comparable sequences or to sample a sequence in a deterministic fashion at approximately regular intervals, in order to reduce memory consumption and processing time. Although very useful, the minimizers selection procedure has undesirable behaviors (e.g. too many k-mers are selected when processing certain sequences). Some of these problems were already known to the authors of the minimizers technique, and the natural lexicographic ordering of k-mers used by minimizers was recognized as their origin. Many software tools using minimizers employ ad hoc variations of the lexicographic order to alleviate those issues. Results We provide an in-depth analysis of the effect of k-mer ordering on the performance of the minimizers technique. By using small universal hitting sets (a recently defined concept), we show how to significantly improve the performance of minimizers and avoid some of its worse behaviors. Based on these results, we encourage bioinformatics software developers to use an ordering based on a universal hitting set or, if not possible, a randomized ordering, rather than the lexicographic order. This analysis also settles negatively a conjecture (by Schleimer et al.) on the expected density of minimizers in a random sequence.

  abstract     = {The MUMmer system and the genome sequence aligner nucmer included within it are among the most widely used alignment packages in genomics. Since the last major release of MUMmer version 3 in 2004, it has been applied to many types of problems including aligning whole genome sequences, aligning reads to a reference genome, and comparing different assemblies of the same genome. Despite its broad utility, MUMmer3 has limitations that can make it difficult to use for large genomes and for the very large sequence data sets that are common today. In this paper we describe MUMmer4, a substantially improved version of MUMmer that addresses genome size constraints by changing the 32-bit suffix tree data structure at the core of MUMmer to a 48-bit suffix array, and that offers improved speed through parallel processing of input query sequences. With a theoretical limit on the input size of 141Tbp, MUMmer4 can now work with input sequences of any biologically realistic length. We show that as a result of these enhancements, the nucmer program in MUMmer4 is easily able to handle alignments of large genomes; we illustrate this with an alignment of the human and chimpanzee genomes, which allows us to compute that the two species are 98\% identical across 96\% of their length. With the enhancements described here, MUMmer4 can also be used to efficiently align reads to reference genomes, although it is less sensitive and accurate than the dedicated read aligners. The nucmer aligner in MUMmer4 can now be called from scripting languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby. These improvements make MUMer4 one the most versatile genome alignment packages available.},

  abstract     = {Pairwise alignment of sequences is a fundamental method in modern molecular biology, implemented within multiple bioinformatics tools and libraries. Current advances in sequencing technologies press for the development of faster pairwise alignment algorithms that can scale with increasing read lengths and production yields.In this article, we present the wavefront alignment algorithm (WFA), an exact gap-affine algorithm that takes advantage of homologous regions between the sequences to accelerate the alignment process. As opposed to traditional dynamic programming algorithms that run in quadratic time, the WFA runs in time O(ns), proportional to the read length n and the alignment score s, using O(s2) memory. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits simple data dependencies that can be easily vectorized, even by the automatic features of modern compilers, for different architectures, without the need to adapt the code. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm, together with other state-of-the-art implementations. As a result, we demonstrate that the WFA runs 20–300× faster than other methods aligning short Illumina-like sequences, and 10–100× faster using long noisy reads like those produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.The WFA algorithm is implemented within the wavefront-aligner library, and it is publicly available at https://github.com/smarco/WFA.},

This technique requires good prototypes in order to achieve good results with a reasonable computational cost. When objects are represented by strings, the Median String of a set of strings could be the best prototype for representing the whole set (i.e., the class of the objects). However, obtaining the Median String is an NP-Hard problem, and only approximations to the median string can be computed with a reasonable computational cost. Although proposed algorithms to obtain approximations to Median String are polynomial, their computational cost is quite high (cubic order), and obtaining the prototypes is very costly. In this work, we propose several techniques in order to reduce this computational cost without degrading the classification performance by the Nearest Neighbour rule.},

  abstract     = {The protocols used for library construction, sequencing and data pre-processing can have a great impact on the quality of an assembled transcriptome and the accuracy of gene expression quantification.Before starting an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiment, one should carefully consider using protocols that are strand-specific, that remove ribosomal RNA and that do not require PCR amplification of the template.Strand-specific RNA-seq protocols are important for correctly assembling overlapping transcripts, especially for compact genomes.The reference-based, or ab initio, assembly strategy requires a reference genome and uses much fewer computing resources than the de novo strategy. However, the quality of the genome and the ability of the short-read aligner to align reads across introns will directly influence the accuracy of the assembled transcripts when using the reference-based strategy.The de novo assembly strategy does not use a reference genome but instead uses a De Bruijn graph to represent overlaps between sequences and assemble transcripts. Most de novo approaches require significant computing resources: random access memory (RAM) is the typical limitation. However, de novo assemblers can assemble trans-spliced genes and novel transcripts that are not present in the genome assembly.To take full advantage of the current assembly strategies, a combined assembly approach should be considered that leverages the strengths of reference-based and de novo assembly strategies.Most transcriptome assemblers are still being developed, and the results from these programs should be evaluated using unbiased quantitative metrics.Transcriptome assembly involves an informatics approach to solve an experimental limitation. As sequencing strategies continually improve, it may no longer be necessary in the near future to assemble transcriptomes, as the read length will be longer than any individual transcript.},

  abstract     = {Objective: To assess the genotypic determinants of the virological response to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in a multicentre cohort of antiretroviral (ARV)-experienced patients receiving TDF as a part of a salvage therapy. Methods: HIV-1 genotype was assessed at baseline in a subgroup of 161 patients of the French expanded access program receiving a stable TDF-including regimen for 3 months or more. Reverse transcriptase mutations associated with the viral load decrease at month 3 with a P-value {$<$}0.15 were retained for the construction of a mutation score. The score was then validated using a multivariate analysis and bootstrap resampling method. Results: The strongest association with decrease in viral load was observed with a set of seven mutations (TDF mutation score) that consisted of M41L, E44D, D67N, T69D/N/S, L74V, L210W and T215Y/F RT mutations. The RT K65R mutation and the insertions at codon 69 were not included in the analysis due to low prevalences. A TDF mutation score of ≤2 predicted the absence of resistance to TDF and ≥6 mutations predicted resistance to TDF with corresponding reductions in viral load of –1.3 ±1.1, and +0.1 ±0.7 log10 copies/ml, respectively. In patients with a TDF mutation score of 3–5, the decrease in viral load was –0.8 ±1.0 log10 copies/ml and was considered possibly resistant. In the multivariate analysis, a TDF mutation score ≥6, previous use of amprenavir, indinavir and lopinavir, and co-prescription of didanosine were associated with a worse virological response. The bootstrap analysis showed the robustness of the TDF mutation score. Conclusion: In ARV-experienced patients receiving TDFcontaining regimens, a score derived from seven reverse transcriptase mutations was shown to be independently predictive of the virological response},

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: To study the evolution of multi-drug-resistant HIV-1 in treatment-experienced patients receiving foscarnet (PFA) as part of salvage therapy and to investigate the virological consequences of emerging mutations. METHODS: Genotypic and phenotypic resistance tests were performed on plasma viruses from seven patients at baseline and during treatment with PFA. The phenotypic effects of mutations suspected to be associated with PFA resistance were evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis of wild-type or thymidine analogue mutations (TAM)-carrying pNL4-3. Reversion of single mutations was performed in a patient-derived recombinant clone. RESULTS: Baseline multi-drug-resistant isolates exhibited hypersusceptibility to PFA. In two patients who received {$>$} 12 months of PFA treatment, a novel mutation pattern including K70G, V75T, K219R and L228R emerged. These viruses had 3-6-fold resistance to PFA, a 2-20-fold decrease in resistance to zidovudine compared to baseline, and 14-39-fold resistance to lamivudine, in the absence of M184V. In wild-type clones mutations K70G and V75T induced moderate PFA resistance. In the case of TAMs, combinations of {$>$} or = 3 mutations (K70G+K219R+L228R+/-V75T) induced PFA resistance and decreased zidovudine resistance 3-13-fold. These mutants exhibited high-level lamivudine resistance ({$>$}20-fold) without mutation M184V. Reversion of K70G --{$>$} R and K219R --{$>$} E in a patient-derived clone confirmed the contribution of individual mutations and the negative association between PFA resistance and zidovudine resistance. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of multiple TAMs, hypersusceptibility to PFA was observed and a novel pattern of resistance, including alternative amino acid substitutions at TAM loci, emerged. This mutational pattern was associated with decreases in zidovudine resistance and surprisingly high-level lamivudine resistance.},

Sequence alignments including \&gt;110 000 HIV-1 partial pol consensus sequences from the UK HIV Drug Resistance Database (UK-HDRD), linked to epidemiological and clinical data from the HIV and AIDS Reporting System, were used for transmission cluster analysis.

Others use a multinomial model, that is, a uni-gram language model with integer word counts (e.g. Lewis and Gale 1994; Mitchell 1997). This paper aims to clarify the confusion by describing the differences and details of these two models, and by empirically comparing their classification performance on five text corpora. We find that the multi-variate Bernoulli performs well with small vocabulary sizes, but that the multinomial performs usually performs even better at larger vocabulary sizes—providing on average a 27 \% reduction in error over the multi-variate Bernoulli model at any vocabulary size.},

The primary outcomes for the pilot phase were time to accrue 500 participants and retention; secondary outcomes included incident HIV infection during the deferral period, safety, adherence, and risk compensation. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (number ISRCTN94465371) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02065986).{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We enrolled 544 participants (275 in the immediate group, 269 in the deferred group) between Nov 29, 2012, and April 30, 2014. Based on early evidence of effectiveness, the trial steering committee recommended on Oct 13, 2014, that all deferred participants be offered PrEP. Follow-up for HIV incidence was complete for 243 (94\%) of 259 patient-years in the immediate group versus 222 (90\%) of 245 patient-years in the deferred group. Three HIV infections occurred in the immediate group (1·2/100 person-years) versus 20 in the deferred group (9·0/100 person-years) despite 174 prescriptions of post-exposure prophylaxis in the deferred group (relative reduction 86\%, 90\% CI 64–96, p=0·0001; absolute difference 7·8/100 person-years, 90\% CI 4·3–11·3). 13 men (90\% CI 9–23) in a similar population would need access to 1 year of PrEP to avert one HIV infection. We recorded no serious adverse drug reactions; 28 adverse events, most commonly nausea, headache, and arthralgia, resulted in interruption of PrEp. We detected no difference in the occurrence of sexually transmitted infections, including rectal gonorrhoea and chlamydia, between groups, despite a suggestion of risk compensation among some PrEP recipients.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}In this high incidence population, daily tenofovir–emtricitabine conferred even higher protection against HIV than in placebo-controlled trials, refuting concerns that effectiveness would be less in a real-world setting.

  abstract     = {HIV is among the most generically variable of human pathogens. A comprehensive and detailed description of HIV strains in the pandemic is an important foundation for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The current sequence database for HIV includes almost 800 complete genome sequences, documenting HIV-1 groups M, O, and N, and HIV-2. Among HIV-1 group M strains, responsible for the vast majority of HIV infections worldwide, 743 sequences represent 9 genetic subtypes, 16 circulating recombinant forms (CRF) that are spreading in populations, and a variety of unique recombinant forms (URF), identified so far only from a single individual. The global distribution of HIV is complex and dynamic with regional epidemics harboring only a subset of the global diversity. HIV strains differ enormously in terms of global prevalence. Six strains account for the majority of HIV infections: HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D, and two of the CRF, CRF01-AE and CRF02\_AG, respectively. Many of the known subtypes and recombinant forms are currently rare in the epidemic, but could spread more widely if favorable conditions arise. HIV-2 is largely restricted to West Africa at relatively low prevalence there. Groups O and N of HIV-1 are very rare in the pandemic. The goal of universal coverage of HIV-1 strains by diagnostic tests can be met by minimizing false negative test rates for the six globally prevalent HIV-1 group M strains and HIV-2, and by evaluating systematically coverage of rare subtypes and recombinant forms.

  abstract     = {Herpesviruses comprise an abundant, widely distributed group of large DNA viruses of humans and other vertebrates, and overall are among the most extensively studied large DNA viruses. Many herpesvirus genome sequences have been determined, and interpreted in terms of gene contents to give detailed views of both ubiquitous and lineage-specific functions. Availability of gene sequences has also enabled evaluations of evolutionary relationships. For herpesviruses of mammals, a robust phylogenetic tree has been constructed, which shows many features characteristic of synchronous development of virus and host lineages over large evolutionary timespans. It has also emerged that three distinct groupings of herpesviruses exist: the first containing viruses with mammals, birds and reptiles as natural hosts; the second containing viruses of amphibians and fish; and the third consisting of a single invertebrate herpesvirus. Within each of the first two groups, the genomes show clear evidence of descent from a common ancestor, but relationships between the three groups are extremely remote. Detailed analyses of capsid structures provide the best evidence for a common origin of the three groups. At a finer level, the structure of the capsid shell protein further suggests an element of common origin between herpesviruses and tailed DNA bacteriophages.},

Since evolution encodes information about function into patterns in protein sequences, unsupervised models of variant effects can be learned from sequence data. The approach to date has been to fit a model to a family of related sequences. The conventional setting is limited, since a new model must be trained for each prediction task. We show that using only zero-shot inference, without any supervision from experimental data or additional training, protein language models capture the functional effects of sequence variation, performing at state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors can be classified into nucleoside and nonnucleoside RT inhibitors. Nucleoside RT inhibitors are converted to active triphosphate analogues and incorporated into the DNA in RT-catalyzed reactions. They act as chain terminators blocking DNA synthesis, since they lack the 3′-OH group required for the phosphodiester bond formation. Unfortunately, available therapies do not completely suppress viral replication, and the emergence of drug-resistant HIV variants is facilitated by the high adaptation capacity of the virus. Mutations in the RT-coding region selected during treatment with nucleoside analogues confer resistance through different mechanisms: (i) altering discrimination between nucleoside RT inhibitors and natural substrates (dNTPs) (e.g. Q151M, M184V, etc.), or (ii) increasing the RT's phosphorolytic activity (e.g. M41L, T215Y and other thymidine analogue resistance mutations), which in the presence of a pyrophosphate donor (usually ATP) allow the removal of chain-terminating inhibitors from the 3′ end of the primer. Both mechanisms are implicated in multi-drug resistance. The excision reaction can be modulated by mutations conferring resistance to nucleoside or nonnucleoside RT inhibitors, and by amino acid substitutions that interfere with the proper binding of the template-primer, including mutations that affect RNase H activity. New developments in the field should contribute towards improving the efficacy of current therapies.},

@article{menichelliImprovingPairwiseComparison2018,
  abstract     = {Comparing and aligning protein sequences is an essential task in bioinformatics. More specifically, local alignment tools like BLAST are widely used for identifying conserved protein sub-sequences, which likely correspond to protein domains or functional motifs. However, to limit the number of false positives, these tools are used with stringent sequence-similarity thresholds and hence can miss several hits, especially for species that are phylogenetically distant from reference organisms. A solution to this problem is then to integrate additional contextual information to the procedure. Here, we propose to use domain co-occurrence to increase the sensitivity of pairwise sequence comparisons. Domain co-occurrence is a strong feature of proteins, since most protein domains tend to appear with a limited number of other domains on the same protein. We propose a method to take this information into account in a typical BLAST analysis and to construct new domain families on the basis of these results. We used Plasmodium falciparum as a case study to evaluate our method. The experimental findings showed an increase of 14\% of the number of significant BLAST hits and an increase of 25\% of the proteome area that can be covered with a domain. Our method identified 2240 new domains for which, in most cases, no model of the Pfam database could be linked. Moreover, our study of the quality of the new domains in terms of alignment and physicochemical properties show that they are close to that of standard Pfam domains.

PCR can create mutations that masquerade as sequence variants and amplification bias that underrepresents AT-rich and GC-rich regions in target sequences.There are four primary NGS chemistry methods: cyclic reversible termination, sequencing by ligation, pyrosequencing and real-time sequencing, which are described in this Review.To call sequence variants in genomes, NGS reads are aligned to a reference sequence using various bioinformatics mapping tools.Whole-genome sequencing using current NGS platforms is still expensive, but targeting regions of interest may provide an interim solution to analysing hundreds, if not thousands, of samples.To date, the sequences of twelve human genomes have been published using a number of NGS platforms, marking the beginning of personalized genomics.NGS costs will continue to drop in the foreseeable future, although the cost reduction should be weighed against the quality of the produced genome sequence.},

Although mutant RT also unblocked ddAMP-terminated primers more efficiently than wild-type RT, the removal of ddAMP was effectively inhibited by the next complementary dNTP (IC50 approximately equal to 12 microM). In contrast, the removal of AZTMP was not inhibited by dNTPs except at nonphysiological concentrations (IC50 {$>$} 200 microM).},

  abstract  = {A structural knowledge-based vehicle recognition method is modified yielding a new probabilistic foundation for the decisions. The method uses a pre-calculated set of hidden line projected views of articulated polyhedral models of the vehicles. Model view structures are set into correspondence with structures composed from edge lines in the image. The correspondence space is searched utilizing a 4D Hough-type accumulator. Probabilistic models of the background and the error in the measurements of the image structures lead to likelihood estimations that are used for the decision. The likelihood is propagated along the structure of the articulated model. The system is tested on a cluttered outdoor scene. To ensure any-time performance the recognition process is implemented in a data-driven production system.},

  abstract     = {This is a major release from 0.4. Highlights include new functions for plotting heatmaps, possibly while applying clustering algorithms to discover structured relationships. These functions are complemented by new custom colormap functions and a full set of IPython widgets that allow interactive selection of colormap parameters. The palette tutorial has been rewritten to cover these new tools and more generally provide guidance on how to use color in visualizations. There are also a number of smaller changes and bugfixes. Plotting functions Added the heatmap function for visualizing a matrix of data by color-encoding the values. See the docs for more information. Added the clustermap function for clustering and visualizing a matrix of data, with options to label individual rows and columns by colors. See the docs for more information. This work was lead by Olga Botvinnik. lmplot and pairplot get a new keyword argument, markers. This can be a single kind of marker or a list of different markers for each level of the hue variable. Using different markers for different hues should let plots be more comprehensible when reproduced to black-and-white (i.e. when printed). See the github pull request for examples. More generally, there is a new keyword argument in FacetGrid and PairGrid, hue\_kws. This similarly lets plot aesthetics vary across the levels of the hue variable, but more flexibily. hue\_kws should be a dictionary that maps the name of keyword arguments to lists of values that are as long as the number of levels of the hue variable. The argument subplot\_kws has been added to FacetGrid. This allows for faceted plots with custom projections, including maps with Cartopy. Color palettes Added two new functions to create custom color palettes. For sequential palettes, you can use the light\_palette function, which takes a seed color and creates a ramp from a very light, desaturated variant of it. For diverging palettes, you can use the diverging\_palette function to create a balanced ramp between two endpoints to a light or dark midpoint. See the palette tutorial {$<$}palette\_tutorial{$>$} for more information. Added the ability to specify the seed color for light\_palette and dark\_palette as a tuple of husl or hls space values or as a named xkcd color. The interpretation of the seed color is now provided by the new input parameter to these functions. Added several new interactive palette widgets: choose\_colorbrewer\_palette, choose\_light\_palette, choose\_dark\_palette, and choose\_diverging\_palette. For consistency, renamed the cubehelix widget to choose\_cubehelix\_palette (and fixed a bug where the cubehelix palette was reversed). These functions also now return either a color palette list or a matplotlib colormap when called, and that object will be live-updated as you play with the widget. This should make it easy to iterate over a plot until you find a good representation for the data. See the Github pull request or this notebook (download it to use the widgets) for more information. Overhauled the color palette tutorial to organize the discussion by class of color palette and provide more motivation behind the various choices one might make when choosing colors for their data. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in PairGrid that gave incorrect results (or a crash) when the input DataFrame has a non-default index. Fixed a bug in PairGrid where passing columns with a date-like datatype raised an exception. Fixed a bug where lmplot would show a legend when the hue variable was also used on either the rows or columns (making the legend redundant). Worked around a matplotlib bug that was forcing outliers in boxplot to appear as blue. kdeplot now accepts pandas Series for the data and data2 arguments. Using a non-default correlation method in corrplot now implies sig\_stars=False as the permutation test used to significance values for the correlations uses a pearson metric. Removed pdf.fonttype from the style definitions, as the value used in version 0.4 resulted in very large PDF files.},

While the improved read length can provide useful information for downstream analysis, underlying algorithms are challenged by the high error rate. Error correction methods in which accurate short reads are used to correct noisy long reads appear to be attractive to generate high-quality long reads. Methods that align short reads to long reads do not optimally use the information contained in the second generation data, and suffer from large runtimes. Recently, a new hybrid error correcting method has been proposed, where the second generation data is first assembled into a de Bruijn graph, on which the long reads are then aligned.},

Historically, each generation of sequencing technologies was marked by innovative technological achievements and novel applications. Long reads (LRs) are considered as the most advantageous feature of SMS shared by both PacBio and ONT to distinguish SMS from next-generation sequencing (NGS, or the second-generation sequencing) and Sanger sequencing (the first-generation sequencing). Long reads overcome the limitations of NGS and drastically improves the quality of genome assembly. Besides, ONT also contributes several unique features including ultra-long reads (ULRs) with read length above 300~kb and some close to 1 million bp, direct RNA sequencing and superior portability as made possible by pocket-sized MinION sequencer. Here, we review the history of DNA sequencing technologies and associated applications, with a special focus on the advantages as well as the limitations of ULR sequencing in genome assembly.},

Although emerging long-read technologies have enabled ETR assemblies, the accuracy of such assemblies is difficult to evaluate since there are no tools for their quality assessment. Moreover, since the mapping of error-prone reads to ETRs remains an open problem, it is not clear how to polish draft ETR assemblies.To address these problems, we developed the TandemTools software that includes the TandemMapper tool for mapping reads to ETRs and the TandemQUAST tool for polishing ETR assemblies and their quality assessment. We demonstrate that TandemTools not only reveals errors in ETR assemblies but also improves the recently generated assemblies of human centromeres.https://github.com/ablab/TandemTools.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract  = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships.  In this paper we present several improvements that make the Skip-gram model more expressive and enable it to learn higher quality vectors more rapidly.  We show that by subsampling frequent words we obtain significant speedup,  and also learn higher quality representations as measured by our tasks. We also introduce Negative Sampling, a simplified variant of Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) that learns more accurate vectors for frequent words compared to the hierarchical softmax.   An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases.  For example, the meanings of Canada'' and "Air'' cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada''.  Motivated by this example, we present a simple and efficient method for finding phrases, and show that their vector representations can be accurately learned by the Skip-gram model. "},

Both read types can complement one another in a ‘hybrid’ approach to whole-genome shotgun sequencing projects, but assembly software must be modified to accommodate their different characteristics. This is true even of pyrosequencing mated and unmated read combinations. Without special modifications, assemblers tuned for homogeneous sequence data may perform poorly on hybrid data.Results: Celera Assembler was modified for combinations of ABI 3730 and 454 FLX reads. The revised pipeline called CABOG (Celera Assembler with the Best Overlap Graph) is robust to homopolymer run length uncertainty, high read coverage and heterogeneous read lengths. In tests on four genomes, it generated the longest contigs among all assemblers tested. It exploited the mate constraints provided by paired-end reads from either platform to build larger contigs and scaffolds, which were validated by comparison to a finished reference sequence. A low rate of contig mis-assembly was detected in some CABOG assemblies, but this was reduced in the presence of sufficient mate pair data.Availability: The software is freely available as open-source from http://wgs-assembler.sf.net under the GNU Public License.Contact:jmiller@jcvi.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In these trials, there was a high prevalence of HIV-1 resistance mutations, with 94\% of patients having nucleoside-associated mutations and 71\% having thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAMs).

This ORF could encode a protein of approximately 190 amino acid residues with a relative molecular mass of 20 kilodaltons if translation began from the first initiation codon.

  abstract   = {Viruses are microbial parasites that insert information into the cell that they have infected to divert the host synthetic systems to make viral rather than cellular components. The process is absolutely dependent on living cells as viruses have no metabolic machinery themselves. The virus consists of a replicating unit or replicon, and a packaging system to deliver the virus to the cell; if either of these essential but distinct elements is missing the virus cannot multiply. All living things have their own viruses. New methods of virus discovery based on nucleic acid detection rather than infection of cells or disease in organisms are revealing more and more forms, many of which are not yet linked to any disease or disorder. The intimate connection between the cell and the virus makes it possible to study cellular processes in detail but also means that treating virus infections is not straightforward. Key Concepts: Viruses are intracellular parasites that require the machinery of living cells to replicate. They consist of an informational molecule (RNA or DNA) in a delivery package that enables them to move from cell to cell. They have been identified by the diseases they cause, their ability to infect cell cultures and increasingly by purely molecular methods such as deep sequencing. The origin of viruses is not known. Viruses replicate by subverting the cell machinery to the manufacture of virus by subtle means. Some are the causative agents of devastating diseases yet equally some seem to have no ill effects. The intimate relationship between virus and cell means that they can be used to investigate the details of cellular processes but they are difficult to attack.},

@article{minTargetNetFunctionalMicroRNA2022,
  abstract     = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation by binding to target sites of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). While identifying functional targets of miRNAs is of utmost importance, their prediction remains a great challenge. Previous computational algorithms have major limitations. They use conservative candidate target site (CTS) selection criteria mainly focusing on canonical site types, rely on laborious and time-consuming manual feature extraction, and do not fully capitalize on the information underlying miRNA–CTS interactions.In this article, we introduce TargetNet, a novel deep learning-based algorithm for functional miRNA target prediction. To address the limitations of previous approaches, TargetNet has three key components: (i) relaxed CTS selection criteria accommodating irregularities in the seed region, (ii) a novel miRNA–CTS sequence encoding scheme incorporating extended seed region alignments and (iii) a deep residual network-based prediction model. The proposed model was trained with miRNA–CTS pair datasets and evaluated with miRNA–mRNA pair datasets. TargetNet advances the previous state-of-the-art algorithms used in functional miRNA target classification. Furthermore, it demonstrates great potential for distinguishing high-functional miRNA targets. The codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/mswzeus/TargetNet.},

But these models usually operate as black boxes: While they are good at predicting, they are often not interpretable. Many inherently interpretable models have been suggested, which come at the cost of losing predictive power. Another option is to apply interpretability methods to a black box model after model training. Given the velocity of research on new machine learning models, it is preferable to have model-agnostic tools which can be applied to a random forest as well as to a neural network. Tools for model-agnostic interpretability methods should improve the adoption of machine learning.},

The correspondence analysis identified non-B-specific and subtype-specific polymorphisms which should not be mistaken for mutations. Multiple chi(2) were performed to detect the differences between naïve vs treated subjects and between different subtypes. To verify the contribution of each single mutation to the resistance levels as predicted by the Virtual Phenotype-LM, simple univariate linear regression was used with fold resistance as a dependent variable and individual mutations as predictors. Commonly accepted protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) positions along with mutants at RT positions 118 and 90 were significantly associated with treatment. Two unusual PR (K14R and I66F) and five RT positions (E28K, S68G, H221Y, L228R/H and P294A) were also associated with treatment (p{$<$}0.01). Only minimal variations were observed with respect to commonly accepted amino acid changes. All amino acid changes correlated with treatment influenced the resistance levels to each single drug. Our findings demonstrate that there are no substantial differences regarding known resistance-associated mutations and the newly emergent substitutions between non-B and B subtype strains.},

ARV analytes were identified among 18\% of those reporting HIV-negative status and 18\% of those reporting not being on ART. Among participants reporting diagnosis over a year prior, 19\% reported multiple HIV tests in the past year. Qualitative results indicated that participant misunderstandings about their care and treatment played a substantial role in reporting inaccuracies. Participants conflated the term HIV test with CD4 and viral load testing, and confusion with terminology was compounded by recall difficulties. Data entry errors likely also played a role. Frequent discrepancies between biomarkers and self-reported data were more likely due to poor understanding of care and treatment and biomedical terminology than intentional misreporting. Results indicate a need for improving patient-provider communication, in addition to incorporating objective measures of treatment and care behaviors such as ARV analytes, to reduce inaccuracies.},

  abstract     = {The similarity in the three-dimensional structures of homologous proteins imposes strong constraints on their sequence variability. It has long been suggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at different sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to disentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently introduced direct-coupling analysis (DCA). Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of DCA, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings, and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.},

  abstract     = {Cladistic analysis is an approach to phylogeny reconstruction that groups taxa in such a way that those with historically more-recent ancestors form groups nested within groups of taxa with more-distant ancestors. This nested set of taxa can be represented as a branching diagram or tree (a cladogram), which is an hypothesis of the evolutionary history of the taxa. The analysis is performed by searching for nested groups of shared derived character states. These shared derived character states define monophyletic groups of taxa (clades), which include all of the descendants of the most recent common ancestor. If all of the characters for a set of taxa are congruent, then reconstructing the phylogenetic tree is unproblematic. However, most real data sets contain incongruent characters, and consequently a wide range of tree-building methods has been developed. These methods differ in a variety of characteristics, and they may produce topologically distinct trees for a single data set. None of the currently-available methods are simultaneously efficient, powerful, consistent and robust, and thus there is no single ideal method. However, many of them appear to perform well under a wide range of conditions, with the exception of the UPGMA method and the Invariants method.},

Standard approaches are a mainstay of modern molecular biology and rely on variations of edit distance to obtain explicit alignments between pairs of biological sequences. However, sequence alignment algorithms struggle with remote homology tasks and cannot identify similarities between many pairs of proteins with similar structures and likely homology. Recent work suggests that using machine learning language models can improve remote homology detection. To this end, we introduce DeepBLAST, that obtains explicit alignments from residue embeddings learned from a protein language model integrated into an end-to-end differentiable alignment framework. This approach can be accelerated on the GPU architectures and outperforms conventional sequence alignment techniques in terms of both speed and accuracy when identifying structurally similar proteins.},

  abstract     = {The selection of in vivo resistance to lopinavir was characterized by analyzing the longitudinal isolates from 54 protease inhibitor-experienced subjects who either experienced incomplete virologic response or viral rebound subsequent to initial response while on treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir in Phase II and III studies. The evolution of incremental resistance to lopinavir (emergence of new mutation[s] and/or at least a twofold increase in phenotypic resistance compared to baseline isolates) was highly dependent on the baseline phenotype and genotype. Among the subjects demonstrating evolution of lopinavir resistance, mutations at positions 82, 54, and 46 in human immunodeficiency virus protease emerged frequently, suggesting that these mutations are important for conferring high-level resistance. Less common mutations, such as L33F, I50V, and V32I together with I47V/A, were also selected; however, new mutations at positions 84, 90, and 71 were not observed. The emergence of incremental resistance contrasts greatly with the low incidence of resistance observed after initiating lopinavir-ritonavir therapy in antiretroviral-naive patients, suggesting that partial resistance accumulated during prior protease inhibitor therapy can compromise the genetic barrier to resistance to lopinavir-ritonavir. The emergence of incremental resistance was uncommon in subjects whose baseline isolates contained eight or more mutations associated with lopinavir resistance and/or displayed {$>$}60-fold-reduced susceptibility to lopinavir, providing insight into suitable upper genotypic and phenotypic breakpoints for lopinavir-ritonavir.},

Score matrices for database search programs or phylogenetic analysis rely on such models of protein evolution. Pioneering work was done by Dayhoff et al. (1978) who formulated a Markov model of evolution and derived the famous PAM score matrices. Her estimation procedure for amino acid exchange frequencies is restricted to pairs of proteins that have a constant and small degree of divergence. Here we present an improved estimator, called the resolvent method, that is not subject to these limitations. This extension of Dayhoff's approach enables us to estimate an amino acid substitution model from alignments of varying degree of divergence. Extensive simulations show the capability of the new estimator to recover accurately the exchange frequencies among amino acids. Based on the SYSTERS database of aligned protein families (Krause and Vingron, 1998) we recompute a series of score matrices.},

  abstract     = {Given a transmembrane protein, we wish to find related ones by a database search. Due to the strongly hydrophobic amino acid composition of transmembrane domains, suboptimal results are obtained when general-purpose scoring matrices such as BLOSUM are used. Recently, a transmembrane-specific score matrix called PHAT was shown to perform much better than BLOSUM. In this article, we derive a transmembrane score matrix family, called SLIM, which has several distinguishing features. In contrast to currently used matrices, SLIM is non-symmetric. The asymmetry arises because different background compositions are assumed for the transmembrane query and the unknown database sequences. We describe the mathematical model behind SLIM in detail and show that SLIM outperforms PHAT both on simulated data and in a realistic setting. Since non-symmetric score matrices are a new concept in database search methods, we discuss some important theoretical and practical issues.Contact: muelle\_t@molgen.mpg.de},

  abstract     = {Sequencing technologies have advanced to the point where it is possible to generate high-accuracy, haplotype-resolved, chromosome-scale assemblies. Several long-read sequencing technologies are available, and a growing number of algorithms have been developed to assemble the reads generated by those technologies. When starting a new genome project, it is therefore challenging to select the most cost-effective sequencing technology, as well as the most appropriate software for assembly and polishing. It is thus important to benchmark different approaches applied to the same sample.Here, we report a comparison of 3 long-read sequencing technologies applied to the de novo assembly of a plant genome, Macadamia jansenii. We have generated sequencing data using Pacific Biosciences (Sequel I), Oxford Nanopore Technologies (PromethION), and BGI (single-tube Long Fragment Read) technologies for the same sample. Several assemblers were benchmarked in the assembly of Pacific Biosciences and Nanopore reads. Results obtained from combining long-read technologies or short-read and long-read technologies are also presented. The assemblies were compared for contiguity, base accuracy, and completeness, as well as sequencing costs and DNA material requirements.The 3 long-read technologies produced highly contiguous and complete genome assemblies of M. jansenii. At the time of sequencing, the cost associated with each method was significantly different, but continuous improvements in technologies have resulted in greater accuracy, increased throughput, and reduced costs. We propose updating this comparison regularly with reports on significant iterations of the sequencing technologies.},

Two novel encoding methods based on physicochemical properties of the amino acids are proposed and an extensive comparison with several standard encoding methods is performed on three different classification problems (HIV-protease, recognition of T-cell epitopes and prediction of peptides that bind human leukocyte antigens). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new encodings and show that the frequently used orthonormal encoding is inferior compared to other methods.},

We have introduced two new mechanisms to generate an initial population: the first mechanism is to generate guide trees with randomly selected sequences and the second is shuffling the sequences inside such trees. Two different genetic operators have been implemented with GAPAM. To test the performance of our algorithm, we have compared it with existing well-known methods, such as PRRP, CLUSTALX, DIALIGN, HMMT, SB\_PIMA, ML\_PIMA, MULTALIGN, and PILEUP8, and also other methods, based on genetic algorithms (GA), such as SAGA, MSA-GA, and RBT-GA, by solving a number of benchmark datasets from BAliBase 2.0. To make a fairer comparison with the GA based algorithms such as MSA-GA and RBT-GA, we have performed further experiments covering all the datasets reported by those two algorithms. The experimental results showed that GAPAM achieved better solutions than the others for most of the cases, and also revealed that the overall performance of the proposed method outperformed the other methods mentioned above.},

  abstract     = {A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

Among the most important factors that are responsible for this progress are the development of new statistical methods and advances in computational technology. In particular, phylogenetic analysis of DNA or protein sequences has become a powerful tool for studying molecular evolution. Along with this developing technology, the application of the new statistical and computational methods has become more complicated and there is no comprehensive volume that treats these methods in depth. Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics fills this gap and present various statistical methods that are easily accessible to general biologists as well as biochemists, bioinformatists and graduate students. The text covers measurement of sequence divergence, construction of phylogenetic trees, statistical tests for detection of positive Darwinian selection, inference of ancestral amino acid sequences, construction of linearized trees, and analysis of allele frequency data. Emphasis is given to practical methods of data analysis, and methods can be learned by working through numerical examples using the computer program MEGA2 that is provided.},

Unfortunately, the straightforward vector encoding of k-mer as a one-hot vector is vulnerable to the curse of dimensionality. Worse yet, the distance between any pair of one-hot vectors is equidistant. This is particularly problematic when applying the latest machine learning algorithms to solve problems in biological sequence analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel method to train distributed representations of variable-length k-mers. Our method is based on the popular word embedding model word2vec, which is trained on a shallow two-layer neural network. Our experiments provide evidence that the summing of dna2vec vectors is akin to nucleotides concatenation. We also demonstrate that there is correlation between Needleman-Wunsch similarity score and cosine similarity of dna2vec vectors.},

However, since transmembrane regions of a protein are in a distinctly different environment than globular proteins, one would expect generalized substitution matrices to be inappropriate for transmembrane regions. RESULTS: We present the PHAT (predicted hydrophobic and transmembrane) matrix, which significantly outperforms generalized matrices and a previously published transmembrane matrix in searches with transmembrane queries. We conclude that a better matrix can be constructed by using background frequencies characteristic of the twilight zone, where low-scoring true positives have scores indistinguishable from high-scoring false positives, rather than the amino acid frequencies of the database. The PHAT matrix may help improve the accuracy of sequence alignments and evolutionary trees of membrane proteins.},

However, the intricate structural complexity and high ML dimensionality of biomolecular datasets obstruct the efficient application of ML algorithms in the field. In addition to data and algorithm, an efficient ML machinery for biomolecular predictions must include structural representation as an indispensable component. Mathematical representations that simplify the biomolecular structural complexity and reduce ML dimensionality have emerged as a prime winner in D3R Grand Challenges. This review is devoted to the recent advances in developing low-dimensional and scalable mathematical representations of biomolecules in our laboratory. We discuss three classes of mathematical approaches, including algebraic topology, differential geometry, and graph theory. We elucidate how the physical and biological challenges have guided the evolution and development of these mathematical apparatuses for massive and diverse biomolecular data. We focus the performance analysis on protein–ligand binding predictions in this review although these methods have had tremendous success in many other applications, such as protein classification, virtual screening, and the predictions of solubility, solvation free energies, toxicity, partition coefficients, protein folding stability changes upon mutation, etc.},

Converting genome sequence to graph by using frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) is an excellent gene sequence mapping technology, which can store rich genetic information into FCGR graphics. To each FCGR image, we construct its perceptual image hashing (PIH) matrix using the bicubic interpolation zooming. The difference of the perceptual hash matrix of each two images is calculated, and the clustering distance of the corresponding two gene sequences is represented by the differentials of the perceptual hash matrix. In this paper, we aligned and analyzed several typical genome sequence datasets including mammalian mitochondrial genes, human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) to build their evolutionary trees. Experimental results showed that our PIH combining FCGR method (FCGR-PIH) has similar classification accuracy to the classical Clustal W sequence alignment method. Furthermore, 25 complete mitochondrial DNA sequences of cichlid fishes and 27 Escherichia coli/Shigella full genome sequences were selected from the AFproject test platform for tests. The performance benchmark rankings demonstrate the effectiveness of the FCGR-PIH algorithm and its potential for large-scale genome sequence analysis.},

  abstract     = {Comparative sequence analyses, including such fundamental bioinformatics techniques as similarity searching, sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference, have become a mainstay for researchers studying type 1 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) genome structure and evolution. Implicit in comparative analyses is an underlying model of evolution, and the chosen model can significantly affect the results. In general, evolutionary models describe the probabilities of replacing one amino acid character with another over a period of time. Most widely used evolutionary models for protein sequences have been derived from curated alignments of hundreds of proteins, usually based on mammalian genomes. It is unclear to what extent these empirical models are generalizable to a very different organism, such as HIV-1–the most extensively sequenced organism in existence. We developed a maximum likelihood model fitting procedure to a collection of HIV-1 alignments sampled from different viral genes, and inferred two empirical substitution models, suitable for describing between-and within-host evolution. Our procedure pools the information from multiple sequence alignments, and provided software implementation can be run efficiently in parallel on a computer cluster. We describe how the inferred substitution models can be used to generate scoring matrices suitable for alignment and similarity searches. Our models had a consistently superior fit relative to the best existing models and to parameter-rich data-driven models when benchmarked on independent HIV-1 alignments, demonstrating evolutionary biases in amino-acid substitution that are unique to HIV, and that are not captured by the existing models. The scoring matrices derived from the models showed a marked difference from common amino-acid scoring matrices. The use of an appropriate evolutionary model recovered a known viral transmission history, whereas a poorly chosen model introduced phylogenetic error. We argue that our model derivation procedure is immediately applicable to other organisms with extensive sequence data available, such as Hepatitis C and Influenza A viruses.},

  abstract     = {MOTIVATION: In order to increase the accuracy of multiple sequence alignments, we designed a new strategy for optimizing multiple sequence alignments by genetic algorithm. We named it COFFEE (Consistency based Objective Function For alignmEnt Evaluation). The COFFEE score reflects the level of consistency between a multiple sequence alignment and a library containing pairwise alignments of the same sequences. RESULTS: We show that multiple sequence alignments can be optimized for their COFFEE score with the genetic algorithm package SAGA. The COFFEE function is tested on 11 test cases made of structural alignments extracted from 3D\_ali. These alignments are compared to those produced using five alternative methods. Results indicate that COFFEE outperforms the other methods when the level of identity between the sequences is low. Accuracy is evaluated by comparison with the structural alignments used as references. We also show that the COFFEE score can be used as a reliability index on multiple sequence alignments. Finally, we show that given a library of structure-based pairwise sequence alignments extracted from FSSP, SAGA can produce high-quality multiple sequence alignments. The main advantage of COFFEE is its flexibility. With COFFEE, any method suitable for making pairwise alignments can be extended to making multiple alignments.

When used to optimise the well known sums of pairs objective function, SAGA performs better than some of the widely used alternative packages.

The method is broadly based on the popular progressive approach to multiple alignment but avoids the most serious pitfalls caused by the greedy nature of this algorithm. With T-Coffee we pre-process a data set of all pair-wise alignments between the sequences. This provides us with a library of alignment information that can be used to guide the progressive alignment. Intermediate alignments are then based not only on the sequences to be aligned next but also on how all of the sequences align with each other. This alignment information can be derived from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment programs and/or structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the power of the approach by using a combination of local and global pair-wise alignments to generate the library. The resulting alignments are significantly more reliable, as determined by comparison with a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives that we tried. The improvement, especially clear with the more difficult test cases, is always visible, regardless of the phylogenetic spread of the sequences in the tests.},

@article{novakPrevalenceAntiretroviralDrug2005,
  abstract     = {Background. The prevalence of drug resistance among persons with newly acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is well documented. However, it is unclear to what extent these mutations persist in chronically infected, treatment-naive patients.Methods. Prevalence of and factors associated with genotypic drug resistance were analyzed retrospectively in a subset of 491 chronically HIV-infected, antiretroviral-naive patients enrolled at 25 cities in the Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical Research on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Flexible Initial Retrovirus Suppressive Therapies trial during 1999–2001. Resistance was defined on the basis of the International AIDS Society 2003 definition, as well as the presence of additional mutations at codons 215 (C/D/E/S) and 69 (A/N/S) in the pol gene. Prevalence of mutations was estimated by use of techniques for stratified random samples. Logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with resistance.Results. Among the 491 chronically HIV-infected patients (mean CD4 cell count, 269 cells/mm3; 31\% of patients had a prior AIDS diagnosis), 57 (11.6\%) had ⩾1 resistance mutation, resulting in an estimated prevalence for the cohort of 10.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 9.5\%–12.1\%). The prevalence was 8.8\% if the 118I mutation was excluded. By drug class, the estimated prevalence of mutations conferring resistance to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors was 7.8\%, and the prevalence was 3.0\% for nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and 0.7\% for protease inhibitors. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, non-Hispanic white subjects were twice as likely than African American subjects to have resistance (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95\% CI, 1.1–4.1; P = .03), and there was a 40\% increase per year in prevalence of mutations by later year of enrollment (OR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.0–2.1; P = .05).Conclusions. These results demonstrate the persistence of drug resistance mutations in chronically HIV-infected patients and an increasing prevalence of resistance over time, and they support genotyping of virus at baseline for chronically HIV-infected patients.},

@article{nurkHiCanuAccurateAssembly2020,
  abstract     = {Complete and accurate genome assemblies form the basis of most downstream genomic analyses and are of critical importance. Recent genome assembly projects have relied on a combination of noisy long-read sequencing and accurate short-read sequencing, with the former offering greater assembly continuity and the latter providing higher consensus accuracy. The recently introduced Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi sequencing technology bridges this divide by delivering long reads ({$>$}10 kbp) with high per-base accuracy ({$>$}99.9\%). Here we present HiCanu, a modification of the Canu assembler designed to leverage the full potential of HiFi reads via homopolymer compression, overlap-based error correction, and aggressive false overlap filtering. We benchmark HiCanu with a focus on the recovery of haplotype diversity, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) variants, satellite DNAs, and segmental duplications. For diploid human genomes sequenced to 30× HiFi coverage, HiCanu achieved superior accuracy and allele recovery compared to the current state of the art. On the effectively haploid CHM13 human cell line, HiCanu achieved an NG50 contig size of 77 Mbp with a per-base consensus accuracy of 99.999\% (QV50), surpassing recent assemblies of high-coverage, ultralong Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) reads in terms of both accuracy and continuity. This HiCanu assembly correctly resolves 337 out of 341 validation BACs sampled from known segmental duplications and provides the first preliminary assemblies of nine complete human centromeric regions. Although gaps and errors still remain within the most challenging regions of the genome, these results represent a significant advance toward the complete assembly of human genomes.},

The concept relies on the detection of DNA polymerase activity by an enzymatic luminometric inorganic pyrophosphate detection assay (P. Nyrén, 1987, Anal. Biochem. 167, 235-238). Immobilized DNA fragments amplified with the polymerase chain reaction are used as template. A detection primer is annealed in front of the mutation and four aliquots of this mixture are incubated with DNA polymerase and one of the four different dideoxynucleotides. The presence or absence of an incorporated dideoxynucleotide is thereafter monitored by the release of inorganic pyrophosphate during the following primer extension step. We show that the concept can be used for sequencing of single bases as well as step-wise analysis of several subsequent bases.},

The HPP has engaged proteomics teams around the world, strongly influenced data-sharing, enhanced quality assurance, and issued stringent guidelines for claims of detecting previously “missing proteins.” This invited perspective complements papers on “A High-Stringency Blueprint of the Human Proteome” and “The Human Proteome Reaches a Major Milestone” in special issues of Nature Communications and Journal of Proteome Research, respectively, released in conjunction with the October 2020 virtual HUPO Congress and its celebration of the 10th anniversary of the HUPO HPP.,                                        •               The global Human Proteome Project is the flagship activity of the HUPO.                                         •               HPP Guidelines for MS Data have greatly enhanced confidence in proteomics data.                                         •               The community has identified proteins from 90\% of predicted protein-coding genes.                                         •               A total of 1899 predicted proteins lack sufficient evidence of expression as of 2020.                                 , Starting from several organ-oriented projects, HUPO in 2010 launched the Human Proteome Project to identify and characterize the protein parts list and integrate proteomics into multiomics research.

In addition to the high error rates of reads, non-uniformity of errors leads to difficulties in various downstream analyses using long reads. Many useful simulators, which characterize long-read error patterns and simulate them, have been developed. However, there is still room for improvement in the simulation of the non-uniformity of errors.To capture characteristics of errors in reads for long-read sequencers, here, we introduce a generative model for quality scores, in which a hidden Markov Model with a latest model selection method, called factorized information criteria, is utilized. We evaluated our developed simulator from various points, indicating that our simulator successfully simulates reads that are consistent with real reads.The source codes of PBSIM2 are freely available from https://github.com/yukiteruono/pbsim2.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The problem arises in the design of compact hash functions and other data structures for efficient handling of large sequencing datasets. We prove that the problem of hitting a given set of L-long sequences is NP-hard and give a heuristic solution that finds a compact universal k-mer set that hits any set of L-long sequences. The algorithm, called DOCKS (design of compact k-mer sets), works in two phases: (i)~finding a minimum-size k-mer set that hits every infinite sequence; (ii)~greedily adding k-mers such that together they hit all remaining L-long sequences. We show that DOCKS works well in practice and produces a set of k-mers that is much smaller than a random choice of k-mers. We present results for various values of k and sequence lengths L and by applying them to two bacterial genomes show that universal hitting k-mers improve on minimizers.

  abstract     = {The evaluation of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) is still an open task in bioinformatics. Current MSA scores do not agree about how alignments must be accurately evaluated. Consequently, it is not trivial to know the quality of MSAs when reference alignments are not provided. Recent scores tend to use more complex evaluations adding supplementary biological features. In this work, a set of novel regression approaches are proposed for the MSA evaluation, comparing several supervised learning and mathematical methodologies. Therefore, the following models specifically designed for regression are applied: regression trees, a bootstrap aggregation of regression trees (bagging trees), least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) and Gaussian processes. These algorithms consider a heterogeneous set of biological features together with other standard MSA scores in order to predict the quality of alignments. The most relevant features are then applied to build novel score schemes for the evaluation of alignments. The proposed algorithms are validated by using the BAliBASE benchmark. Additionally, an statistical ANOVA test is performed to study the relevance of these scores considering three alignment factors. According to the obtained results, the four regression models provide accurate evaluations, even outperforming other standard scores such as BLOSUM, PAM or STRIKE.},

Biases and artefacts introduced by these experimental steps may hinder some applications.Recent technological developments, including direct RNA sequencing, may alleviate some of the limitations of current RNA-seq approaches and enable new paths of research into transcriptomics.Although several technological barriers still remain, major advances towards reliable analyses of RNAs from limited cell quantities have recently been achieved, paving the way towards transcriptome profiling at the single-cell level.},

Standard methods, proposed in the literature, do not cope with the measurement cost issue. Including the measurement cost into the feature selection process is difficult when features are grouped together due to the implementation. If one feature from a group is requested, all others are available for zero additional measurement cost. In the paper, we investigate two approaches how to use the measurement cost and feature grouping in the selection process. We show, that employing grouping improves the performance significantly for low measurement costs. We discuss an application where limiting the computation time is a very important topic: the segmentation of backscatter images in product analysis.},

@article{pailaGenomeBiasInfluences2008,
  abstract     = {The genomic era has seen a remarkable increase in the number of genomes being sequenced and annotated. Nonetheless, annotation remains a serious challenge for compositionally biased genomes. For the preliminary annotation, popular nucleotide and protein comparison methods such as BLAST are widely employed. These methods make use of matrices to score alignments such as the amino acid substitution matrices. Since a nucleotide bias leads to an overall bias in the amino acid composition of proteins, it is possible that a genome with nucleotide bias may have introduced atypical amino acid substitutions in its proteome. Consequently, standard matrices fail to perform well in sequence analysis of these genomes. To address this issue, we examined the amino acid substitution in the AT-rich genome of Plasmodium falciparum, chosen as a reference and reconstituted a substitution matrix in the genome's context. The matrix was used to generate protein sequence alignments for the parasite proteins that improved across the functional regions. We attribute this to the consistency that may have been achieved amid the target and background frequencies calculated exclusively in our study. This study has important implications on annotation of proteins that are of experimental interest but give poor sequence alignments with standard conventional matrices.},

Although previous studies have compared the alignment accuracy of different MSA programs, their computational time and memory usage have not been systematically evaluated. Given the unprecedented amount of data produced by next generation deep sequencing platforms, and increasing demand for large-scale data analysis, it is imperative to optimize the application of software. Therefore, a balance between alignment accuracy and computational cost has become a critical indicator of the most suitable MSA program. We compared both accuracy and cost of nine popular MSA programs, namely CLUSTALW, CLUSTAL OMEGA, DIALIGN-TX, MAFFT, MUSCLE, POA, Probalign, Probcons and T-Coffee, against the benchmark alignment dataset BAliBASE and discuss the relevance of some implementations embedded in each program’s algorithm. Accuracy of alignment was calculated with the two standard scoring functions provided by BAliBASE, the sum-of-pairs and total-column scores, and computational costs were determined by collecting peak memory usage and time of execution.},

Firstly, it is the development of a computational model for visual attention in humans and animals, which is consistent with the known psychophysical experiments and neurology findings in early vision mechanisms. Secondly, it is a model-based design of an attention operator in computer vision, which is capable to detect, locate, and trace objects of interest in images in a fast way. The proposed attention operator, named image relevance function, is an image local operator that has local maximums at the centers of locations of supposed objects of interest or their relevant parts. This approach has several advantageous features in detecting objects in images due to the model-based design of the relevance function and the utilization of the maximum likelihood decision.},

However, since currently used treatments are unable to eradicate HIV from infected individuals, therapy must be lifelong, with the potential for short- and long-term, known and unknown, side effects, and high costs for health care systems. In addition, different patterns of unexpected systemic complications involving heart, bone, kidney and other organs are emerging. Although their pathogenesis is still under debate, they are likely to originate from chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction associated to HIV infection. A final consideration regards the dishomogenous pattern of HIV disease worldwide. In fact, access to HIV diagnosis, treatment and care are seriously limited in the geographical areas that are most affected, like Africa, which sustains 70\% of the global burden of the infection. This is one of the greatest challenges that international institutions are asked to face today.},

Methods An expert panel was created to provide recommendations for the update of the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (HIVDB) GRT-IS. The panel was polled on the ARVs to be included in a GRT report, and the drug-resistance interpretations associated with 160 drug-resistance mutation (DRM) pattern-ARV combinations. The DRM pattern-ARV combinations included 52 nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI) DRM pattern-ARV combinations (13 patterns x 4 NRTIs), 27 nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI) DRM pattern-ARV combinations (9 patterns x 3 NNRTIs), 39 protease inhibitor (PI) DRM pattern-ARV combinations (13 patterns x 3 PIs) and 42 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) DRM pattern-ARV combinations (14 patterns x 3 INSTIs). Results There was universal agreement that a GRT report should include the NRTIs lamivudine, abacavir, zidovudine, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; the NNRTIs efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, and rilpivirine; the PIs atazanavir/r, darunavir/r, and lopinavir/r (with “/r” indicating pharmacological boosting with ritonavir or cobicistat); and the INSTIs dolutegravir, elvitegravir, and raltegravir. There was a range of opinion as to whether the NRTIs stavudine and didanosine and the PIs nelfinavir, indinavir/r, saquinavir/r, fosamprenavir/r, and tipranavir/r should be included. The expert panel members provided highly concordant DRM pattern-ARV interpretations with only 6\% of NRTI, 6\% of NNRTI, 5\% of PI, and 3\% of INSTI individual expert interpretations differing from the expert panel median by more than one resistance level. The expert panel median differed from the HIVDB 7.0 GRT-IS for 20 (12.5\%) of the 160 DRM pattern-ARV combinations including 12 NRTI, two NNRTI, and six INSTI pattern-ARV combinations. Eighteen of these differences were updated in HIVDB 8.1 GRT-IS to reflect the expert panel median. Additionally, HIVDB users are now provided with the option to exclude those ARVs not considered to be universally required. Conclusions The HIVDB GRT-IS was updated through a collaborative process to reflect changes in HIV drug resistance knowledge, treatment guidelines, and expert opinion. Such a process broadens consensus among experts and identifies areas requiring further study.},

  abstract     = {The high-throughput - next generation sequencing (HT-NGS) technologies are currently the hottest topic in the field of human and animals genomics researches, which can produce over 100 times more data compared to the most sophisticated capillary sequencers based on the Sanger method. With the ongoing developments of high throughput sequencing machines and advancement of modern bioinformatics tools at unprecedented pace, the target goal of sequencing individual genomes of living organism at a cost of \$1,000 each is seemed to be realistically feasible in the near future. In the relatively short time frame since 2005, the HT-NGS technologies are revolutionizing the human and animal genome researches by analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to DNA microarray (ChIP-chip) or sequencing (ChIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), whole genome genotyping, genome wide structural variation, de novo assembling and re-assembling of genome, mutation detection and carrier screening, detection of inherited disorders and complex human diseases, DNA library preparation, paired ends and genomic captures, sequencing of mitochondrial genome and personal genomics. In this review, we addressed the important features of HT-NGS like, first generation DNA sequencers, birth of HT-NGS, second generation HT-NGS platforms, third generation HT-NGS platforms: including single molecule Heliscope™, SMRT™ and RNAP sequencers, Nanopore, Archon Genomics X PRIZE foundation, comparison of second and third HT-NGS platforms, applications, advances and future perspectives of sequencing technologies on human and animal genome research.},

The average intervening sequence length between them versus the percentage of residue identity in pairwise alignments shows an exponential behaviour, suggesting a stochastic process such that nearly every loop in an ancestral structure is a possible target for indels during evolution. The results also suggest a limit to the average size of indels accommodated by protein structures. The preferred indel conformations are reverse turn and coil as are the preferred conformations at the indel edges (N- and C-terminal sides).

  abstract     = {A new generation of sequencing technologies is revolutionizing molecular biology. Illumina’s Solexa and Applied Biosystems’ SOLiD generate gigabases of nucleotide sequence per week. However, a perceived limitation of these ultra-high-throughput technologies is their short read-lengths. De novo assembly of sequence reads generated by classical Sanger capillary sequencing is a mature field of research. Unfortunately, the existing sequence assembly programs were not effective for short sequence reads generated by Illumina and SOLiD platforms. Early studies suggested that, in principle, sequence reads as short as 20–30 nucleotides could be used to generate useful assemblies of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome sequences, albeit containing many gaps. The early feasibility studies and proofs of principle inspired several bioinformatics research groups to implement new algorithms as freely available software tools specifically aimed at assembling reads of 30–50 nucleotides in length. This has led to the generation of several draft genome sequences based exclusively on short sequence Illumina sequence reads, recently culminating in the assembly of the 2.25-Gb genome of the giant panda from Illumina sequence reads with an average length of just 52 nucleotides. As well as reviewing recent developments in the field, we discuss some practical aspects such as data filtering and submission of assembly data to public repositories.},

  abstract     = {\emph{Objectives:} A wide array of monitoring tests is commercially available to gauge HIV-1 disease progression and the overall health status of an HIV-1-infected patient. Viral load tests provide a picture of viral activity, while CD4 cell counts shed light on the immune status and can help physicians to prevent the development of opportunistic infections in patients. On the other hand, genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing and therapeutic drug monitoring help to optimize HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy. Resistance testing is currently recommended within the standard of care guidelines to aid the choice of new drug regimens following treatment failure(s). \emph{Methods:} Genotypic testing described here is based on the amplification and sequencing of an HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) region from a patient sample to identify resistance mutations associated with PR and RT inhibitor resistance. A genotypic test takes a week to perform and the results are reported as a list of detected mutations. The virco®TYPE HIV-1 report uses genotypic data to predict phenotypic susceptibility by linear regression modeling that uses a large correlative database of genotype-phenotype pairs. Phenotypic testing measures the ability of the virus to replicate in the presence of a drug and provides a direct measurement of drug susceptibility in vitro. Since phenotypic analysis is laborious and time consuming (28 days), genotypic resistance testing is currently the standard reference method used for HIV-1 resistance testing. However, a phenotypic test is important when a patient harbors virus with complex genetic patterns, or when the mutational resistance profile for a particular drug is not well-characterized. \emph{Results and Conclusions:} Some of the currently used resistance tests are partially automated enabling laboratories to increase overall efficiency. However, maximum automation and standardization of the process, instruments and software that we have described here can overcome many of the problems encountered with current tests and aims at having a compliant, high-throughput, diagnostic laboratory, which can guarantee sample integrity from sample reception to result reporting. We also describe in detail the development and performance of virco®TYPE HIV-1 (genotype) and Antivirogram® (phenotype) assay on PR and RT genes to evaluate antiretroviral resistance.},

  abstract     = {{$<$}p{$>$}Since Anfinsen demonstrated that the information encoded in a protein's amino acid sequence determines its structure in 1973, solving the protein structure prediction problem has been the Holy Grail of structural biology. The goal of protein structure prediction approaches is to utilize computational modeling to determine the spatial location of every atom in a protein molecule starting from only its amino acid sequence. Depending on whether homologous structures can be found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), structure prediction methods have been historically categorized as template-based modeling (TBM) or template-free modeling (FM) approaches. Until recently, TBM has been the most reliable approach to predicting protein structures, and in the absence of reliable templates, the modeling accuracy sharply declines. Nevertheless, the results of the most recent community-wide assessment of protein structure prediction experiment (CASP14) have demonstrated that the protein structure prediction problem can be largely solved through the use of end-to-end deep machine learning techniques, where correct folds could be built for nearly all single-domain proteins without using the PDB templates. Critically, the model quality exhibited little correlation with the quality of available template structures, as well as the number of sequence homologs detected for a given target protein. Thus, the implementation of deep-learning techniques has essentially broken through the 50-year-old modeling border between TBM and FM approaches and has made the success of high-resolution structure prediction significantly less dependent on template availability in the PDB library.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract  = {Efficient dynamic programming algorithms are available for a broad class of protein and DNA sequence comparison problems. These algorithms require computer time proportional to the product of the lengths of the two sequences being compared [O(N2)] but require memory space proportional only to the sum of these lengths [O(N)]. Although the requirement for O(N2) time limits use of the algorithms to the largest computers when searching protein and DNA sequence databases, many other applications of these algorithms, such as calculation of distances for evolutionary trees and comparison of a new sequence to a library of sequence profiles, are well within the capabilities of desktop computers. In particular, the results of library searches with rapid searching programs, such as FASTA2,48 or BLAST49, should be confirmed by performing a rigorous optimal alignment. Whereas rapid methods do not overlook significant sequence similarities,64 FASTA limits the number of gaps that can be inserted into an alignment, so that a rigorous alignment may extend the alignment substantially in some cases. BLAST does not allow gaps in the local regions that it reports; a calculation that allows gaps is very likely to extend the alignment substantially. Although a Monte Carlo evaluation of the statistical significance of a similarity score with a rigorous algorithm is much slower than the heuristic approach used by the RDF2 program,2 the dynamic programming approach should take less than 1 hr on a 386-based PC or desktop Unix workstation. For descriptive purposes, we have limited our discussion to methods for calculating similarity scores and distances that use gap penalties of the form g = rk. Nevertheless, programs for the more general case (g = q + rk) are readily available.9,23 Versions of these programs that run either on Unix workstations, IBM-PC class computers, or the Macintosh can be obtained from either of the authors.},

FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments.

Different similarity scoring matrices are most effective at different evolutionary distances. "Deep" scoring matrices like BLOSUM62 and BLOSUM50 target alignments with 20 - 30\% identity, while "shallow" scoring matrices (e.g. VTML10 - VTML80), target alignments that share 90 - 50\% identity, reflecting much less evolutionary change. While "deep" matrices provide very sensitive similarity searches, they also require longer sequence alignments and can sometimes produce alignment overextension into non-homologous regions. Shallower scoring matrices are more effective when searching for short protein domains, or when the goal is to limit the scope of the search to sequences that are likely to be orthologous between recently diverged organisms. Likewise, in DNA searches, the match and mismatch parameters set evolutionary look-back times and domain boundaries. In this unit, we will discuss the theoretical foundations that drive practical choices of protein and DNA similarity scoring matrices and gap penalties. Deep scoring matrices (BLOSUM62 and BLOSUM50) should be used for sensitive searches with full-length protein sequences, but short domains or restricted evolutionary look-back require shallower scoring matrices.},

@article{pecerskaQuantifyingTransmissionFitness2021,
  abstract     = {As multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) continues to spread, investigating the transmission potential of different drug-resistant strains becomes an ever more pressing topic in public health. While phylogenetic and transmission tree inferences provide valuable insight into possible transmission chains, phylodynamic inference combines evolutionary and epidemiological analyses to estimate the parameters of the underlying epidemiological processes, allowing us to describe the overall dynamics of disease spread in the population. In this study, we introduce an approach to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) phylodynamic analysis employing an existing computationally efficient model to quantify the transmission fitness costs of drug resistance with respect to drug-sensitive strains. To determine the accuracy and precision of our approach, we first perform a simulation study, mimicking the simultaneous spread of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) strains. We analyse the simulated transmission trees using the phylodynamic multi-type birth-death model (MTBD, (Kühnert et~al., 2016)) within the BEAST2 framework and show that this model can estimate the parameters of the epidemic well, despite the simplifying assumptions that MTBD makes compared to the complex TB transmission dynamics used for simulation. We then apply the MTBD model to an M. tuberculosis lineage 4 dataset that primarily consists of MDR sequences. Some of the MDR strains additionally exhibit resistance to pyrazinamide~– an important first-line anti-tuberculosis drug. Our results support the previously proposed hypothesis that pyrazinamide resistance confers a transmission fitness cost to the bacterium, which we quantify for the given dataset. Importantly, our sensitivity analyses show that the estimates are robust to different prior distributions on the resistance acquisition rate, but are affected by the size of the dataset – i.e. we estimate a higher fitness cost when using fewer sequences for analysis. Overall, we propose that MTBD can be used to quantify the transmission fitness cost for a wide range of pathogens where the strains can be appropriately divided into two or more categories with distinct properties.},

At the end of 2011, more than eight million HIV-infected people were receiving ART in low-income and middle-income countries. ART generally works well in keeping the virus suppressed and the patient healthy. However, treatment only works as long as the virus is not resistant against the drugs used. In the last decades, HIV treatments have become better and better at slowing down the evolution of drug resistance, so that some patients are treated for many years without having any resistance problems. However, for some patients, especially in low-income countries, drug resistance is still a serious threat to their health. This essay will review what is known about transmitted and acquired drug resistance, multi-class drug resistance, resistance to newer drugs, resistance due to treatment for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, the role of minority variants (low-frequency drug-resistance mutations), and resistance due to pre-exposure prophylaxis.},

To fully exploit these features, real-time base calling is required. Up to date, this has only been achieved at the cost of high computing requirements that pose limitations in terms of hardware availability in common laptops and energy consumption.We developed a new base caller DeepNano-coral for nanopore sequencing, which is optimized to run on the Coral Edge Tensor Processing Unit, a small USB-attached hardware accelerator. To achieve this goal, we have designed new versions of two key components used in convolutional neural networks for speech recognition and base calling. In our components, we propose a new way of factorization of a full convolution into smaller operations, which decreases memory access operations, memory access being a bottleneck on this device. DeepNano-coral achieves real-time base calling during sequencing with the accuracy slightly better than the fast mode of the Guppy base caller and is extremely energy efficient, using only 10\,W of power.https://github.com/fmfi-compbio/coral-basecallerSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

It joins variants that arise independently within the same molecule, creating new opportunities for viruses to overcome selective pressures and to adapt to new environments and hosts. Consequently, the analysis of viral recombination attracts the interest of clinicians, epidemiologists, molecular biologists and evolutionary biologists. In this review we present an overview of three major areas related to viral recombination: (i) the molecular mechanisms that underlie recombination in model viruses, including DNA-viruses (Herpesvirus) and RNA-viruses (Human Influenza Virus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus), (ii) the analytical procedures to detect recombination in viral sequences and to determine the recombination breakpoints, along with the conceptual and methodological tools currently used and a brief overview of the impact of new sequencing technologies on the detection of recombination, and (iii) the major areas in the evolutionary analysis of viral populations on which recombination has an impact. These include the evaluation of selective pressures acting on viral populations, the application of evolutionary reconstructions in the characterization of centralized genes for vaccine design, and the evaluation of linkage disequilibrium and population structure.},

  abstract  = {Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) of homologous sequences contain information on structural and functional constraints and their evolutionary histories. Despite their importance for many downstream tasks, such as structure prediction, MSA generation is often treated as a separate pre-processing step, without any guidance from the application it will be used for. Here, we implement a smooth and differentiable version of the Smith-Waterman pairwise alignment algorithm that enables jointly learning an MSA and a downstream machine learning system in an end-to-end fashion. To demonstrate its utility, we introduce SMURF (Smooth Markov Unaligned Random Field), a new method that jointly learns an alignment and the parameters of a Markov Random Field for unsupervised contact prediction. We find that SMURF learns MSAs that mildly improve contact prediction on a diverse set of protein and RNA families. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that by connecting our differentiable alignment module to AlphaFold and maximizing predicted confidence, we can learn MSAs that improve structure predictions over the initial MSAs. Interestingly, the alignments that improve AlphaFold predictions are self-inconsistent and can be viewed as adversarial. This work highlights the potential of differentiable dynamic programming to improve neural network pipelines that rely on an alignment and the potential dangers of relying on black-box methods for optimizing predictions of protein sequences.},

@article{phipsonPermutationPvaluesShould2010,
  abstract     = {Permutation tests are amongst the most commonly used statistical tools in modern genomic research, a process by which p-values are attached to a test statistic by randomly permuting the sample or gene labels. Yet permutation p-values published in the genomic literature are often computed incorrectly, understated by about 1/m, where m is the number of permutations. The same is often true in the more general situation when Monte Carlo simulation is used to assign p-values. Although the p-value understatement is usually small in absolute terms, the implications can be serious in a multiple testing context. The understatement arises from the intuitive but mistaken idea of using permutation to estimate the tail probability of the test statistic. We argue instead that permutation should be viewed as generating an exact discrete null distribution. The relevant literature, some of which is likely to have been relatively inaccessible to the genomic community, is reviewed and summarized. A computation strategy is developed for exact p-values when permutations are randomly drawn. The strategy is valid for any number of permutations and samples. Some simple recommendations are made for the implementation of permutation tests in practice.},

  abstract     = {Background To investigate differences in pathogenesis, diagnosis and resistance pathways between HIV-1 subtypes, an accurate subtyping tool for large datasets is needed. We aimed to evaluate the performance of automated subtyping tools to classify the different subtypes and circulating recombinant forms using pol, the most sequenced region in clinical practice. We also present the upgraded version 3 of the Rega HIV subtyping tool (REGAv3). Methodology HIV-1 pol sequences (PR+RT) for 4674 patients retrieved from the Portuguese HIV Drug Resistance Database, and 1872 pol sequences trimmed from full-length genomes retrieved from the Los Alamos database were classified with statistical-based tools such as COMET, jpHMM and STAR; similarity-based tools such as NCBI and Stanford; and phylogenetic-based tools such as REGA version 2 (REGAv2), REGAv3, and SCUEAL. The performance of these tools, for pol, and for PR and RT separately, was compared in terms of reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity with respect to the gold standard which was manual phylogenetic analysis of the pol region. Results The sensitivity and specificity for subtypes B and C was more than 96\% for seven tools, but was variable for other subtypes such as A, D, F and G. With regard to the most common circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), the sensitivity and specificity for CRF01\_AE was ∼99\% with statistical-based tools, with phylogenetic-based tools and with Stanford, one of the similarity based tools. CRF02\_AG was correctly identified for more than 96\% by COMET, REGAv3, Stanford and STAR. All the tools reached a specificity of more than 97\% for most of the subtypes and the two main CRFs (CRF01\_AE and CRF02\_AG). Other CRFs were identified only by COMET, REGAv2, REGAv3, and SCUEAL and with variable sensitivity. When analyzing sequences for PR and RT separately, the performance for PR was generally lower and variable between the tools. Similarity and statistical-based tools were 100\% reproducible, but this was lower for phylogenetic-based tools such as REGA (∼99\%) and SCUEAL (∼96\%). Conclusions REGAv3 had an improved performance for subtype B and CRF02\_AG compared to REGAv2 and is now able to also identify all epidemiologically relevant CRFs. In general the best performing tools, in alphabetical order, were COMET, jpHMM, REGAv3, and SCUEAL when analyzing pure subtypes in the pol region, and COMET and REGAv3 when analyzing most of the CRFs. Based on this study, we recommend to confirm subtyping with 2 well performing tools, and be cautious with the interpretation of short sequences.},

  abstract     = {Objective Sexual partner concurrency is common among men who have sex with men (MSM) and may increase the probability of HIV transmission during recent (acute or early) infection. We examined the relationship between concurrency and HIV transmission network characteristics (proxies for HIV transmission) among MSM with recent HIV infection. Design Observational study integrating behavioral, clinical, and molecular epidemiology. Methods We inferred a partial HIV transmission network using 986 HIV-1 pol sequences obtained from HIV-infected individuals in San Diego, California (1996-2015). We further analyzed data from 285 recently HIV-infected MSM in the network who provided information on up to three sexual partners in the past three months, including the timing of intercourse with each partner. Concurrency was defined as sexual partners overlapping in time. Logistic and negative binomial regression were used to investigate the link between concurrency and HIV transmission network characteristics (i.e., clustering and degree or number of connections to others in the network) among these MSM. Results Of recently HIV-infected MSM (N=285), 54\% reported concurrent partnerships and 54\% were connected by ≥1 putative transmission link to others (i.e., clustered) in the network (median degree=1.0; interquartile range: 0.0-3.0). Concurrency was positively associated with HIV transmission network clustering (adjusted odds ratio=1.83, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-3.10) and degree (adjusted incidence rate ratio=1.48, 95\% CI: 1.02-2.15) Conclusions Our findings provide empirical evidence consistent with the hypothesis that concurrency facilitates HIV transmission during recent infection. Interventions to mitigate the impact of concurrency on HIV transmission may help curb the HIV epidemic among MSM.},

  abstract     = {HIV-1 integrase is a rational target for anti-HIV therapy, and the feasibility and efficacy of integrase inhibitors in animal models has been recently demonstrated.Integrase catalyses the insertion of the viral cDNA ends generated by reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome into host chromosomes. The integration reaction consists of two consecutive steps: 3′-processing and strand transfer.Several structures of retroviral integrases have been solved. Integrase is structurally similar to other DNA-processing polynucleotide transferases, including the Tn5 and mu transposases, RuvC recombinase, RnaseH and the RNase component Argonaute. All of these contain a conserved DDE motif required for enzymatic activity. Divalent metals (almost certainly at least one, and probably two, Mg2+ or Mn2+ atoms) coordinate the integrase DDE motif, the viral cDNA and chromosomal DNA for the integration reactions.Integrase can be used for high-throughput screening and a variety of inhibitors from diverse chemical classes have been identified. Criteria required to demonstrate targeting of cellular integrase are reviewed.Diketo acids and diketo-like acids are the most promising integrase inhibitors. They are referred to as strand-transfer inhibitors because they uncouple the two integrase reactions. They can block strand transfer without affecting 3′-processing by chelating divalent cofactors in the integrase active site and by interfering with host (acceptor) DNA binding.Strand-transfer inhibitors probably bind at the interface of the integrase–metal cofactor–viral DNA ternary complex by chelating the divalent metal, and thereby interfering with the binding of the chromosomal target DNA. Strand-transfer inhibitors are candidate interfacial inhibitors, and represent a new mechanism of action in drug discovery.},

  abstract     = {For infectious diseases, a genetic cluster is a group of closely related infections that is usually interpreted as representing a recent outbreak of transmission. Genetic clustering methods are becoming increasingly popular for molecular epidemiology, especially in the context of HIV where there is now considerable interest in applying these methods to prioritize groups for public health resources such as pre-exposure prophylaxis. To date, genetic clustering has generally been performed with ad hoc algorithms, only some of which have since been encoded and distributed as free software. These algorithms have seldom been validated on simulated data where clusters are known, and their interpretation and similarities are not transparent to users outside of the field. Here, I provide a brief overview on the development and inter-relationships of genetic clustering methods, and an evaluation of six methods on data simulated under an epidemic model in a risk-structured population. The simulation analysis demonstrates that the majority of clustering methods are systematically biased to detect variation in sampling rates among subpopulations, not variation in transmission rates. I discuss these results in the context of previous work and the implications for public health applications of genetic clustering.},

@article{poonMappingProteaseInhibitor2007,
  abstract     = {Resistance genotyping provides an important resource for the clinical management of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, resistance to protease (PR) inhibitors (PIs) is a complex phenotype shaped by interactions among nearly half of the residues in HIV-1 PR. Previous studies of the genetic basis of PI resistance focused on fixed substitutions among populations of HIV-1, i.e., host-specific adaptations. Consequently, they are susceptible to a high false discovery rate due to founder effects. Here, we employ sequencing “mixtures” (i.e., ambiguous base calls) as a site-specific marker of genetic variation within patients that is independent of the phylogeny. We demonstrate that the transient response to selection by PIs is manifested as an excess of nonsynonymous mixtures. Using a sample of 5,651 PR sequences isolated from both PI-naive and -treated patients, we analyze the joint distribution of mixtures and eight PIs as a Bayesian network, which distinguishes residue-residue interactions from direct associations with PIs. We find that selection for resistance is associated with the emergence of nonsynonymous mixtures in two distinct groups of codon sites clustered along the substrate cleft and distal regions of PR, respectively. Within-patient evolution at several positions is independent of PIs, including those formerly postulated to be involved in resistance. These positions are under strong positive selection in the PI-naive patient population, implying that other factors can produce spurious associations with resistance, e.g., mutational escape from the immune response.},

  abstract   = {Viruses infecting members of Archaea, the third domain of life, constitute an integral, yet unique part of the virosphere. Many of these viruses, specifically the species that infect hyperthermophilic hosts, display morphotypes – for example, bottle shaped, spindle shaped, droplet shaped, coil shaped, bacilliform – not known to be associated with the other two cellular domains, Bacteria and Eukarya. The distinctiveness of the hyperthermophilic archaeal viruses extends to their genome sequences: a large majority of the predicted genes yield no sequence matches in public databases and encode proteins with exceptional structures and unknown functions. Moreover, the ways in which these viruses interact with their hosts are also unique, as indicated by a unique virion egress mechanism, which involves formation of pyramidal portals on the cell surface. Some viruses that infect extremely halophilic Archaea are morphologically highly similar to head-tail bacterial viruses of the order Caudovirales and apparently share an ancestry with them. Identified archaeal viruses almost exclusively carry double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) genomes and only a few species have single-stranded DNA genomes. Key Concepts Archaea, the third domain of life, same as the two other domains, Bacteria and Eukarya, is parasitised by viruses. Known species of archaeal viruses have been isolated from environments with extreme conditions – extremely high temperatures, exceeding 80 °C, or extremely high salinity. Known archaeal viruses have DNA genomes, most of which are double stranded. Morphological diversity of archaeal viruses exceeds that of bacterial viruses (bacteriophages). Archaeal viruses from extreme thermal environments are enveloped and have diverse unusual morphologies, indicative of multiple independent origins. Most known viruses from highly saline waters resemble bacteriophages and share an ancestry with them. Most of the genes of hyperthermophilic archaeal viruses have no homologues in other known viruses. The knowledge on viruses of Archaea contributes to the understanding of the origin and evolution of viruses and virus–host interactions.},

  abstract     = {So far, all characterized archaeal viruses carry dsDNA genomes and exhibit a wide range of virion morphotypes, strongly surpassing the dsDNA viruses of the Bacteria in their diversity.In addition to head-tail viruses, which are common in the Bacteria, the Archaea replicate many viruses with morphologies which have not been observed before for any dsDNA virus. These include fusiforms, droplet and bottle shapes, and linear and spherical virions, with more complex virions combining features of the different forms.Genome sequence analyses demonstrate that most of the archaeal viruses are unrelated to other known viruses and indicate that they might have different, and possibly multiple, evolutionary origins.Assuming that archaeal head-tail viruses originate from the domain Bacteria (there are many arguments for this suggestion), we are faced with the prospect that each of the three domains of life, the Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya, was originally characterized by a unique set of associated dsDNA viruses.One possible explanation for the existence of three different 'virospheres', each associated with a specific domain, is that these virospheres were selected when the domains first arose. Therefore, the first evolving organisms of each separate domain could have already been infected by different subsets of viruses from the ancestral virosphere, which predated the last universal common ancestor.},

  abstract     = {Background We recently described FastTree, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to FastTree that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability. Methodology/Principal Findings Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the “CAT” approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100–1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory. Conclusions/Significance FastTree 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. FastTree 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

  abstract     = {The ability to characterize repetitive regions of the human genome is limited by the read lengths of short-read sequencing technologies. Although long-read sequencing technologies such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio)~and Oxford Nanopore Technologies can potentially overcome this limitation, long segmental duplications with high sequence identity pose challenges for long-read mapping. We describe a probabilistic method, DuploMap, designed to improve the accuracy of long-read mapping in segmental duplications. It analyzes reads mapped to segmental duplications using existing long-read aligners and leverages paralogous sequence variants (PSVs)—sequence differences between paralogous sequences—to distinguish between multiple alignment locations. On simulated datasets, DuploMap increased the percentage of correctly mapped reads with high confidence for multiple long-read aligners including Minimap2 (74.3–90.6\%) and BLASR (82.9–90.7\%) while maintaining high precision. Across multiple whole-genome long-read datasets, DuploMap aligned an additional 8–21\% of the reads in segmental duplications with high confidence relative to Minimap2. Using DuploMap-aligned PacBio circular consensus sequencing reads, an additional 8.9 Mb of DNA sequence was mappable, variant calling achieved a higher F1~score and 14~713 additional variants supported by linked-read data were identified. Finally, we demonstrate that a significant fraction of PSVs in segmental duplications overlaps with variants and adversely impacts short-read variant calling.},

  abstract     = {This review describes the state-of-the-art in statistical, machine learning, and expert-advised computational methods for the evaluation and optimization of combination antiretroviral therapy, with respect to the virologic outcomes in HIV-1-infected patients. Currently employed methodologies are based on the paradigm for which mutations present in patient viral genotypes, selected either by treatment or already transmitted to the patient as resistant mutants, are the major drivers of virologic outcomes. Genotypic interpretation systems have been designed with the prime objective of characterizing the resistance to individual drugs, deriving scores from the association of viral genotypes with in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility or in vivo response to treatment. Nevertheless, the very large range of possible drug combinations and of viral mutational patterns leads to an extremely complex scenario, making prediction of in vivo treatment response extremely challenging. To deal with such complexity, machine learning methods are being increasingly explored, thanks to the availability of exponentially growing HIV data bases in recent years. The combination of genotypic interpretation systems with other laboratory markers, treatment history, past clinical events, and the usage of data-driven techniques has dramatically raised the confidence in predicting virologic outcomes. A few of these systems have been implemented as free web-services, indicating ranks of suitable combination antiretroviral therapy regimens given a patient's clinical background. Future perspectives in the field foresee the extension of therapy optimization systems to newly approved antiretroviral drug targets and the prediction of other clinical outcomes, rather than the sole virologic response.},

  abstract     = {Background In 2019, WHO reported that the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance to first-line regimens of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is increasing in countries with a low number of therapeutic options. This increasing prevalence of drug resistance is an important threat to ending the AIDS pandemic, as it compromises individual clinical outcomes and increases the risk of transmission. In countries with a high number of therapeutic options, little global information is available regarding the prevalence of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infections, which presents a potential challenge for the clinical management of people with HIV. Even after the approval of two new antiretroviral drug classes in 2007, which were intended to help alleviate this problem, some cases of infection with HIV-1 that show limited susceptibility to the five available antiretroviral classes have been described. We did a thorough in-vitro evaluation of the drug resistance profile of HIV-1 from an observational case to show that five-class pan-resistant clinical cases do exist. Methods We investigated a case of a highly treatment-experienced Caucasian male with HIV-1 who had a poor virological response to previous combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who was not responding to a dolutegravir-based regimen. For the complete panel of approved antiretrovirals, we examined genotypic resistance using the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database interpretation algorithm, and we examined phenotypic resistance using the PhenoSense and Trofile assays. Using viral gp160 sequence analysis, we also explored the potential susceptibility of this virus to novel therapeutic drugs targeting viral envelope binding. Findings The individual was diagnosed with HIV-1 on Sept 29, 1989. Since starting antiretroviral treatment in 1995, the individual had received more than 14 different antiretroviral drugs over the course of his illness. In November, 2017, a blood sample was collected from the individual and we did drug resistance analysis tests. We found that this individual was infected with a pan-resistant HIV-1 subtype B strain that showed broad genotypic and phenotypic cross-resistance to all approved antiretroviral drugs, including the newest second-generation integrase inhibitors, dolutegravir and bictegravir. With no remaining clinical options available, except for investigational drugs, this case provides evidence that new antiretroviral drugs with different mechanisms of action are needed. Interpretation Our case report shows that HIV-1 multidrug cross-resistance remains an important concern, despite the extensive number of antiretroviral drugs currently available. Highly treatment-experienced patients, especially those who have been given suboptimal combination ART, can develop highly complex resistance-associated mutation patterns, conferring cross-resistance to all widely available ARTs. The identification and reporting of cases, such as the one described in this report, are needed to increase awareness of emerging trends that have the potential to affect patient management.

There are only four known plant SVs: satellite tobacco necrosis virus, satellite tobacco mosaic virus, satellite panicum mosaic virus, and satellite maize white line mosaic virus. These SVs have positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes of 800–1400nt that are encapsidated within \textasciitilde 17-nmT=1 icosahedral virions. SVs, in contrast to satellite-RNA or -DNA, encode a capsid protein for independent genome packaging of the cognate SV RNA. The unusually small and compact nature of these subviral agents has resulted in their use as models for fundamental virology studies, including gene expression, genome packaging, and virion structure.},

  abstract     = {We present a new method for predicting the secondary structure of globular proteins based on non-linear neural network models. Network models learn from existing protein structures how to predict the secondary structure of local sequences of amino acids. The average success rate of our method on a testing set of proteins non-homologous with the corresponding training set was 64.3\% on three types of secondary structure (α-helix, β-sheet, and coil), with correlation coefficients of Cα = 0.41, Cβ = 0.31 and Ccoll = 0.41. These quality indices are all higher than those of previous methods. The prediction accuracy for the first 25 residues of the N-terminal sequence was significantly better. We conclude from computational experiments on real and artificial structures that no method based solely on local information in the protein sequence is likely to produce significantly better results for non-homologous proteins. The performance of our method of homologous proteins is much better than for non-homologous proteins, but is not as good as simply assuming that homologous sequences have identical structures.},

  abstract     = {Motivation: Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.Availability and implementation: BEDTools was written in C++.

We discuss the use of the l1 norm in the Least Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator (LASSO) regression model and the Support Vector Machine model. When tested by cross-validation with laboratory measurements, these models predict viral phenotype, or resistance, in response to Reverse-Transcriptase Inhibitors (RTIs) more accurately than other known models. The l1 norm is the most selective convex function, which sets a large proportion of the parameters to zero and also assures that a single optimal solution will be found, given a particular model formulation and training data set. A statistical model that reliably predicts viral drug response is an important tool in the selection of Anti-Retroviral Therapy. These techniques have general application to modeling phenotype from complex genetic data.},

This discovery stimulated investigation of the pathogenesis of poliomyelitis in many laboratories. Nearly 50 years later, when two effective poliovirus vaccines were developed, the impetus to study poliovirus pathogenesis waned. The identification of the cell receptor for poliovirus, CD155, and its use in the development of transgenic mice susceptible to poliovirus revived interest in understanding how the virus causes disease. Experiments in CD155 transgenic mice have provided new information on the initial sites of virus replication in the host, how the virus spreads to the central nervous system through the blood and by axonal transport, the determinants of viral tropism, and the basis for the attenuation phenotype of the Sabin vaccine strains. Despite these advances, our understanding of poliovirus pathogenesis is still incomplete. The dilemma is not how to answer the remaining questions, but whether there will be sufficient time to do so before global eradication of poliomyelitis leads to cessation of research on the disease.},

Here, we used a standardised approach to compare the UK HIV Drug Resistance Database and the Swiss HIV Cohort Study while maintaining data-protection requirements. Clusters were identified in subtype A1, B and C pol phylogenies.

We used logistic regression to predict cluster membership based on country, sampling date, risk group, ethnicity and sex. We analysed {$>$}8,000 Swiss and {$>$}30,000 UK subtype B sequences. At 4.5\% genetic distance, the UK was more clustered and MSM and heterosexual degree distributions differed significantly by the KS test. The KS test is sensitive to variation in network scale, and jackknifing the UK MSM dataset to the size of the Swiss dataset removed the difference. Only heterosexuals varied based on the DDQC, due to UK male heterosexuals who clustered exclusively with MSM. Their removal eliminated this difference. In conclusion, the UK and Swiss HIV epidemics have similar underlying dynamics and observed differences in clustering are mainly due to different population sizes.},

There is little evidence that fitness differences among strains determine their population structure and distribution.Genetic recombination is a fundamental mechanism for the evolution of HIV.The development of drug treatments has greatly extended life expectancy and quality of life for those who are HIV positive but the development of drug resistance has been a major setback.Recombination can rapidly bring together resistance mutations for multiple drugs during combination therapy.The development of a vaccine for HIV has been a frustratingly slow process with the few candidate vaccines that have made it to phase III trials demonstrating no efficacy.The high rate of evolution means that the pattern of diversity of HIV is changing at an alarming rate.Vaccines are therefore aiming at a constantly moving target.},

In a few instances, these clever strategies also facilitate escape from the host’s defense responses. The process of replication is typically divided into the phases of attachment, entry, uncoating, genome replication and expression, assembly, maturation, and finally, egress or release from the host cell.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised protein language models trained across millions of diverse sequences learn structure and function of proteins. Protein language models studied to date have been trained to perform inference from individual sequences. The longstanding approach in computational biology has been to make inferences from a family of evolutionarily related sequences by fitting a model to each family independently. In this work we combine the two paradigms. We introduce a protein language model which takes as input a set of sequences in the form of a multiple sequence alignment. The model interleaves row and column attention across the input sequences and is trained with a variant of the masked language modeling objective across many protein families. The performance of the model surpasses current state-of-the-art unsupervised structure learning methods by a wide margin, with far greater parameter efficiency than prior state-of-the-art protein language models.},

  abstract  = {Unsupervised contact prediction is central to uncovering physical, structural, and functional constraints for protein structure determination and design. For decades, the predominant approach has been to infer evolutionary constraints from a set of related sequences. In the past year, protein language models have emerged as a potential alternative, but performance has fallen short of state-of-the-art approaches in bioinformatics. In this paper we demonstrate that Transformer attention maps learn contacts from the unsupervised language modeling objective. We find the highest capacity models that have been trained to date already outperform a state-of-the-art unsupervised contact prediction pipeline, suggesting these pipelines can be replaced with a single forward pass of an end-to-end model.1},

Mimivirus is a double-stranded DNA virus growing in amoebae. We now present its 1,181,404-base pair genome sequence, consisting of 1262 putative open reading frames, 10\% of which exhibit a similarity to proteins of known functions. In addition to exceptional genome size, Mimivirus exhibits many features that distinguish it from other nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses. The most unexpected is the presence of numerous genes encoding central protein-translation components, including four amino-acyl transfer RNA synthetases, peptide release factor 1, translation elongation factor EF-TU, and translation initiation factor 1. The genome also exhibits six tRNAs. Other notable features include the presence of both type I and type II topoisomerases, components of all DNA repair pathways, many polysaccharide synthesis enzymes, and one intein-containing gene. The size and complexity of the Mimivirus genome challenge the established frontier between viruses and parasitic cellular organisms. This new sequence data might help shed a new light on the origin of DNA viruses and their role in the early evolution of eukaryotes.},

Yet it is often unclear who and where these ‘source’ populations are. Here we demonstrate how viral deep-sequencing can be used to reconstruct HIV-1 transmission networks and to infer the direction of transmission in these networks. We are able to deep-sequence virus from a large population-based sample of infected individuals in Rakai District, Uganda, reconstruct partial transmission networks, and infer the direction of transmission within them at an estimated error rate of 16.3\% [8.8–28.3\%]. With this error rate, deep-sequence phylogenetics cannot be used against individuals in legal contexts, but is sufficiently low for population-level inferences into the sources of epidemic spread. The technique presents new opportunities for characterizing source populations and for targeting of HIV-1 prevention interventions in Africa.},

  abstract   = {In this paper, we introduce Factorization Machines (FM) which are a new model class that combines the advantages of Support Vector Machines (SVM) with factorization models. Like SVMs, FMs are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to SVMs, FMs model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that FMs can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the feature vectors). This makes FMs easily applicable even for users without expert knowledge in factorization models.},

However, traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is time-consuming, low throughput and viable only for cultivable bacteria. Machine learning methods may pave the way for automated AMR prediction based on genomic data of the bacteria. However, comparing different machine learning methods for the prediction of AMR based on different encodings and whole-genome sequencing data without previously known knowledge remains to be done.In this study, we evaluated logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for the prediction of AMR for the antibiotics ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and gentamicin. We could demonstrate that these models can effectively predict AMR with label encoding, one-hot encoding and frequency matrix chaos game representation (FCGR encoding) on whole-genome sequencing data. We trained these models on a large AMR dataset and evaluated them on an independent public dataset. Generally, RFs and CNNs perform better than LR and SVM with AUCs up to 0.96. Furthermore, we were able to identify mutations that are associated with AMR for each antibiotic.Source code in data preparation and model training are provided at GitHub website (https://github.com/YunxiaoRen/ML-iAMR).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract     = {The selection of drug resistant virus is a significant obstacle to the continued successful treatment of HIV infection. Reverse transcriptase is the target for numerous approved anti-HIV drugs including both nucleoside inhibitor (NRTI) and non-nucleosides (NNRTI). The many available crystal structures of RT reveal that, generally, in relation to their binding sites NRTI resistance mutations are generally more distally positioned, whilst for NNRTIs mutations are clustered. Such clustering implies a direct stereochemical basis for NNRTI resistance mechanisms, which is indeed observed in many cases such as the loss of key ring stacking interactions with inhibitors via mutations at Tyr181 and Tyr188. However, there are also indirect resistance mechanisms observed, e.g. V108I (via perturbation of Tyr188 and Tyr181) and K103N (apo-enzyme stabilisation). The resistance mechanism can be NNRTI-dependent as is the case for K101E where either indirect (nevirapine) or direct effects (efavirenz) apply. Structural studies have contributed to the design of newer generation NNRTIs and identified a number of features which may contribute to their much improved resistance profiles. Such factors include reduced interactions with Tyr181, the presence of inhibitor/main-chain H-bonds and ability to undergo conformational flexing and rearrangement within the mutated drug site.},

@article{rheeGenotypicPredictorsHuman2006,
  abstract     = {Understanding the genetic basis of HIV-1 drug resistance is essential to developing new antiretroviral drugs and optimizing the use of existing drugs. This understanding, however, is hampered by the large numbers of mutation patterns associated with cross-resistance within each antiretroviral drug class. We used five statistical learning methods (decision trees, neural networks, support vector regression, least-squares regression, and least angle regression) to relate HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase mutations to in vitro susceptibility to 16 antiretroviral drugs. Learning methods were trained and tested on a public data set of genotype–phenotype correlations by 5-fold cross-validation. For each learning method, four mutation sets were used as input features: a complete set of all mutations in ≥2 sequences in the data set, the 30 most common data set mutations, an expert panel mutation set, and a set of nonpolymorphic treatment-selected mutations from a public database linking protease and reverse transcriptase sequences to antiretroviral drug exposure. The nonpolymorphic treatment-selected mutations led to the best predictions: 80.1\% accuracy at classifying sequences as susceptible, low/intermediate resistant, or highly resistant. Least angle regression predicted susceptibility significantly better than other methods when using the complete set of mutations. The three regression methods provided consistent estimates of the quantitative effect of mutations on drug susceptibility, identifying nearly all previously reported genotype–phenotype associations and providing strong statistical support for many new associations. Mutation regression coefficients showed that, within a drug class, cross-resistance patterns differ for different mutation subsets and that cross-resistance has been underestimated.},

  abstract     = {Despite the high degree of HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) mutation in the setting of antiretroviral therapy, the spectrum of possible virus variants appears to be limited by patterns of amino acid covariation. We analyzed patterns of amino acid covariation in protease and RT sequences from more than 7,000 persons infected with HIV-1 subtype B viruses obtained from the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu). In addition, we examined the relationship between conditional probabilities associated with a pair of mutations and the order in which those mutations developed in viruses for which longitudinal sequence data were available. Patterns of RT covariation were dominated by the distinct clustering of Type I and Type II thymidine analog mutations and the Q151M-associated mutations. Patterns of protease covariation were dominated by the clustering of nelfinavir-associated mutations (D30N and N88D), two main groups of protease inhibitor (PI)\textendash resistance mutations associated either with V82A or L90M, and a tight cluster of mutations associated with decreased susceptibility to amprenavir and the most recently approved PI darunavir. Different patterns of covariation were frequently observed for different mutations at the same position including the RT mutations T69D versus T69N, L74V versus L74I, V75I versus V75M, T215F versus T215Y, and K219Q/E versus K219N/R, and the protease mutations M46I versus M46L, I54V versus I54M/L, and N88D versus N88S. Sequence data from persons with correlated mutations in whom earlier sequences were available confirmed that the conditional probabilities associated with correlated mutation pairs could be used to predict the order in which the mutations were likely to have developed. Whereas accessory nucleoside RT inhibitor\textendash resistance mutations nearly always follow primary nucleoside RT inhibitor\textendash resistance mutations, accessory PI-resistance mutations often preceded primary PI-resistance mutations.},

  abstract     = {There are few large studies of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) prevalence and the drug resistance mutations (DRMs) responsible for TDR in the United States.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease sequences were obtained from 4253 antiretroviral therapy (ART)–naive individuals in a California clinic population from 2003 to 2016. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to study linkages between TDR strains and selection pressure on TDR-associated DRMs.From 2003 to 2016, there was a significant increase in overall (odds ratio [OR], 1.05 per year [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 1.03–1.08]; P \&lt; .001) and nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI)–associated TDR (OR, 1.11 per year [95\% CI, 1.08–1.15]; P \&lt; .001). Between 2012 and 2016, TDR rates to any drug class ranged from 15.7\% to 19.2\%, and class-specific rates ranged from 10.0\% to 12.8\% for NNRTIs, 4.1\% to 8.1\% for nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), and 3.6\% to 5.2\% for protease inhibitors. The thymidine analogue mutations, M184V/I and the tenofovir-associated DRMs K65R and K70E/Q/G/N/T accounted for 82.9\%, 7.3\%, and 1.4\% of NRTI-associated TDR, respectively. Thirty-seven percent of TDR strains clustered with other TDR strains sharing the same DRMs.Although TDR has increased significantly in this large cohort, many TDR strains are unlikely to influence the activity of currently preferred first-line ART regimens. The high proportion of DRMs associated with infrequently used regimens combined with the clustering of TDR strains suggest that some TDR strains are being transmitted between ART-naive individuals.},

Here we present Merqury, a novel tool for reference-free assembly evaluation based on efficient k-mer set operations. By comparing k-mers in a de novo assembly to those found in unassembled high-accuracy reads, Merqury estimates base-level accuracy and completeness. For trios, Merqury can also evaluate haplotype-specific accuracy, completeness, phase block continuity, and switch errors. Multiple visualizations, such as k-mer spectrum plots, can be generated for evaluation.

  abstract     = {Single-molecule, real-time sequencing developed by Pacific BioSciences offers longer read lengths than the second-generation sequencing (SGS) technologies, making it well-suited for unsolved problems in genome, transcriptome, and epigenetics research. The highly-contiguous de novo assemblies using PacBio sequencing can close gaps in current reference assemblies and characterize structural variation (SV) in personal genomes. With longer reads, we can sequence through extended repetitive regions and detect mutations, many of which are associated with diseases. Moreover, PacBio transcriptome sequencing is advantageous for the identification of gene isoforms and facilitates reliable discoveries of novel genes and novel isoforms of annotated genes, due to its ability to sequence full-length transcripts or fragments with significant lengths. Additionally, PacBio’s sequencing technique provides information that is useful for the direct detection of base modifications, such as methylation. In addition to using PacBio sequencing alone, many hybrid sequencing strategies have been developed to make use of more accurate short reads in conjunction with PacBio long reads. In general, hybrid sequencing strategies are more affordable and scalable especially for small-size laboratories than using PacBio Sequencing alone. The advent of PacBio sequencing has made available much information that could not be obtained via SGS alone.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of human immunodeficiency virus resistant to 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT) in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex has been documented. Isolates from non-AZT-treated persons or those who had received AZT for less than six months showed a narrow range of susceptibility to the drug; on the other hand, isolates from those who had received AZT for six months or more consistently showed reduced susceptibility. Five highly AZT-resistant isolates were also insensitive to other compounds containing a 3′-azido group. No cross-resistance was found to other nucleoside analogues, including 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine and 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine. That cross-resistance occurred only in compounds containing a 3′-azido group suggests that mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene prohibit the enzyme from using nucleoside triphosphate containing a 3′-azido group. Progressive, stepwise increases in resistance have been associated with the sequential accumulation of specific amino acid changes in the reverse transcriptase gene. It is not yet known whether the resistant phenotype as determined in vitro results in clinical resistance to AZT. The gradual appearance of resistant isolates, the variable course of human immunodeficiency virus infections, and the absence of a consistent pattern of resurgent p24 antigen will make the emergence of AZT resistance difficult to correlate with clinical status or other markers. The combination of AZT with other drugs that do not share cross-resistance is a promising area for investigation to identify regimens that are more active and less likely to induce resistance.},

The combination antiretroviral regimen, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine, taken as a single pill once daily, has been shown to prevent HIV transmission but is used by fewer than 20\% of people who could benefit in the United States.PubMed was searched on February 15, 2018, using the search terms pre-exposure, prophylaxis, HIV, and PrEP to identify English-language articles published between 2010 and 2018. Four placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with daily dosing of TDF/emtricitabine significantly reduces HIV acquisition in men who have sex with men, high-risk heterosexuals, and injection drug users who share injection equipment. The efficacy of daily TDF/emtricitabine exceeds 90\% but is highly correlated with degree of adherence. TDF/emtricitabine is safe and well-tolerated. Only 2\% of people discontinue PrEP because of adverse effects. Sexually transmitted infections are common among those using PrEP. Resistance to TDF/emtricitabine when used for PrEP is rare (\&lt;0.1\%) and usually occurs when PrEP is inadvertently prescribed to individuals with undiagnosed acute HIV infection who have false-negative findings on HIV antibody/antigen testing due to HIV infection acquired within 7 to 10 days of testing. Effective methods are needed to identify individuals at high risk for acquiring HIV, ensure their access to PrEP, and maximize medication adherence.TDF/emtricitabine is an effective and safe therapy for preventing HIV transmission. Increasing prescription of TDF/emtricitabine for patients at risk of acquiring HIV has the potential to reduce new HIV infections.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy is essential for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients to inhibit viral replication and therewith to slow progression of disease and prolong a patient's life. However, the high mutation rate of HIV can lead to a fast adaptation of the virus under drug pressure and thereby to the evolution of resistant variants. In turn, these variants will lead to the failure of antiretroviral treatment. Moreover, these mutations cannot only lead to resistance against single drugs, but also to cross-resistance, i.e., resistance against drugs that have not yet been applied. METHODS: 662 protease sequences and 715 reverse transcriptase sequences with complete resistance profiles were analyzed using machine learning techniques, namely binary relevance classifiers, classifier chains, and ensembles of classifier chains. RESULTS: In our study, we applied multi-label classification models incorporating cross-resistance information to predict drug resistance for two of the major drug classes used in antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1, namely protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). By means of multi-label learning, namely classifier chains (CCs) and ensembles of classifier chains (ECCs), we were able to improve overall prediction accuracy for all drugs compared to hitherto applied binary classification models. CONCLUSIONS: The development of fast and precise models to predict drug resistance in HIV-1 is highly important to enable a highly effective personalized therapy. Cross-resistance information can be exploited to improve prediction accuracy of computational drug resistance models.},

This index is especially helpful when the aim is not classification itself, but characterizing the most typical conditions of a given conclusion. We show that the index looks like a standardized residual and propose as alternatives other forms of residuals borrowed from the modeling of contingency tables. We then consider two main usages of these indexes. The first is purely descriptive and concerns the a posteriori individual evaluation of the classification rules. The second usage relies upon the strength of implication for assigning the most appropriate conclusion to each leaf of the induced tree. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of this statistical implicative view on decision trees through a full scale real world application.},

In biology, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Learning the natural distribution of evolutionary protein sequence variation is a logical step toward predictive and generative modeling for biology. To this end we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model maps raw sequences to representations of biological properties without labels or prior domain knowledge. The learned representation space organizes sequences at multiple levels of biological granularity from the biochemical to proteomic levels. Learning recovers information about protein structure: secondary structure and residue-residue contacts can be extracted by linear projections from learned representations. With small amounts of labeled data, the ability to identify tertiary contacts is further improved. Learning on full sequence diversity rather than individual protein families increases recoverable information about secondary structure. We show the networks generalize by adapting them to variant activity prediction from sequences only, with results that are comparable to a state-of-the-art variant predictor that uses evolutionary and structurally derived features.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract     = {Recombination contributes to the generation of genetic diversity in human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) but can only occur between viruses replicating within the same cell. Since individuals have not been found to be simultaneously coinfected with multiple divergent strains of HIV-1 or HIV-2, recombination events have been thought to be restricted to the rather closely related members of the quasispecies that evolves during the course of HIV infection. Here we describe examples of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 genomes that appear to be hybrids of genetically quite divergent viruses. Phylogenetic analyses were used to examine the evolutionary relationships among multiple HIV strains. Evolutionary trees derived from different genomic regions were consistent with respect to most of the viruses investigated. However, some strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2 exhibited significantly discordant branching orders indicative of genetic exchanges during their evolutionary histories. The crossover points of these putative recombination events were mapped by examining the distribution of phylogenetically informative sites supporting alternative tree topologies. A similar example of a recombinant simian immunodeficiency virus identified in West African green monkeys has also been described recently. These results indicate that coinfection with highly divergent viral strains can occur in HIV-infected humans and SIV-infected primates and could lead to the generation of hybrid genomes with significantly altered biological properties. Thus, future characterization of primate lentiviruses should include careful phylogenetic investigation of possible genomic mosaicism.},

A dominant method of such string matching is the ‘seed-and-extend’ approach, in which occurrences of short subsequences called ‘seeds’ are used to search for potentially longer matches in a large database of sequences. Each such potential match is then checked to see if it extends beyond the seed. To be effective, the seed-and-extend approach needs to catalogue seeds from virtually every substring in the database of search strings. Projects such as mammalian genome assemblies and large-scale protein matching, however, have such large sequence databases that the resulting list of seeds cannot be stored in RAM on a single computer. This significantly slows the matching process.Results: We present a simple and elegant method in which only a small fraction of seeds, called ‘minimizers’, needs to be stored. Using minimizers can speed up string-matching computations by a large factor while missing only a small fraction of the matches found using all seeds.},

  abstract  = {This paper shows how the eigenstructure of the adjacency matrix can be used for the purposes of robust graph-matching. We commence from the observation that the leading eigenvector of a transition probability matrix is the steady state of the associated Markov chain. When the transition matrix is the normalised adjacency matrix of a graph, then the leading eigenvector gives the sequence of nodes of the steady state random walk on the graph. We use this property to convert the nodes in a graph into a string where the node-order is given by the sequence of nodes visited in the random walk. We match graphs represented in this way, by finding the sequence of string edit operations which minimise edit distance.},

This study analyzes the relative importance of clinical factors in the intrahost HIV-1 subtype B (HIV-1B) evolution and in the fixation of drug resistance mutations (DRM) during longitudinal pediatric HIV-1 infection. We recovered 162 partial HIV-1B pol sequences (from 3 to 24 per patient) from 24 perinatally infected patients from the Madrid Cohort of HIV-1 infected children and adolescents in a time interval ranging from 2.2 to 20.3\,years. We applied machine learning classification methods to analyze the relative importance of 28 clinical/epidemiological/virological factors in the HIV-1B evolution to predict HIV-1B genetic diversity (d), nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations (dN, dS) and DRM presence. Most of the 24 HIV-1B infected pediatric patients were Spanish (91.7\%), diagnosed before 2000 (83.3\%), and all were antiretroviral therapy experienced. They had from 0.3 to 18.8\,years of HIV-1 exposure at sampling time. Most sequences presented DRM. The best-predictor variables for HIV-1B evolutionary parameters were the age of HIV-1 diagnosis for d, the age at first antiretroviral treatment for dN and the year of HIV-1 diagnosis for ds. The year of infection (birth year) and year of sampling seemed to be relevant for fixation of both DRM at large and, considering drug families, to protease inhibitors (PI). This study identifies, for the first time using machine learning, the factors affecting more HIV-1B pol evolution and those affecting DRM fixation in HIV-1B infected pediatric patients.},

@article{RoleHIVPhenotypic,
  abstract = {Contemporary phenotypic assays such as the PhenoSense HIV assay are more straightforward to interpret than genotyping results because they do not require the expert interpretation of complex mutation patterns. The drug susceptibility data provides information for the clinician to select a treatment regimen effective against the predominant viral population circulating in the patient's blood. Compared to traditional phenotypic assays, the PhenoSense HIV assay uses a virus vector and a luciferase reporter gene to provide a quick and sensitive measure of viral replication. The main use of phenotypic assays at present is to identify those antiretroviral drugs that still retain activity against the patient's virus. Phenotypic assays are useful to provide guidance after treatment failure and to select a proper combination of drugs prior to initiation of therapy. They are also useful to detect transmission of resistance virus and to monitor HIV patients during early viral rebound. In essence, phenotypic testing provides information to target antiretroviral therapy against the predominant HIV variant in the patient for a prolonged suppression of viral replication, decreased mortality, and lower health-care costs.},

  abstract     = {Background: Transmission of drug-resistant HIV strains to antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve subjects can negatively impact therapy response. As treatment strategies and utilization of antiretroviral drugs evolve, patterns of transmitted mutations may shift. Method: Paired genotypic and phenotypic susceptibility data were retrospectively analyzed for 317 ART-naïve, HIV–infected subjects from 40 small and major metropolitan cities in the Northeastern, Midwestern, Southern, Southwestern, and Northwestern United States during 2003. Results: Using current (January 2007) PhenoSense cutoffs, HIV-from 8\% of subjects had reduced susceptibility to ⩾1 drug. By class, {$>\%$} had reduced susceptibility to protease inhibitors (PIs), and \% had reduced susceptibility to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs); reduced susceptibility to ⩾1 non–nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTIs) was seen in 7\% of subjects, with 4\% of all subjects having reduced susceptibility to all NNRTIs. IAS–USA–defined NRTI, NNRTI, and/or major PI HIV–drug resistance–associated mutations were detected for 0\% of the subjects. HIV risk factors included homosexual contact (74\%), heterosexual contact (28\%), and injectable drug use/transfusion/other (7\%.Reduced susceptibility to ⩾1 drug was significantly higher (p = .034) for white subjects than African Americansand Hispanics/others. Conclusion: The high prevalence of drug resistance in these ART–naïve subjects suggests thattransmitted resistance is occurring widely within the United States. HIV genotyping and/or phenotyping for antiretroviral-naïve patients seeking treatment should be considered, especially if the therapy will include an NNRTI.},

@article{ruffaloAccurateEstimationShort2012,
  abstract     = {Motivation: Several software tools specialize in the alignment of short next-generation sequencing reads to a reference sequence. Some of these tools report a mapping quality score for each alignment—in principle, this quality score tells researchers the likelihood that the alignment is correct. However, the reported mapping quality often correlates weakly with actual accuracy and the qualities of many mappings are underestimated, encouraging the researchers to discard correct mappings. Further, these low-quality mappings tend to correlate with variations in the genome (both single nucleotide and structural), and such mappings are important in accurately identifying genomic variants.Approach: We develop a machine learning tool, LoQuM (LOgistic regression tool for calibrating the Quality of short read mappings, to assign reliable mapping quality scores to mappings of Illumina reads returned by any alignment tool. LoQuM uses statistics on the read (base quality scores reported by the sequencer) and the alignment (number of matches, mismatches and deletions, mapping quality score returned by the alignment tool, if available, and number of mappings) as features for classification and uses simulated reads to learn a logistic regression model that relates these features to actual mapping quality.Results: We test the predictions of LoQuM on an independent dataset generated by the ART short read simulation software and observe that LoQuM can ‘resurrect’ many mappings that are assigned zero quality scores by the alignment tools and are therefore likely to be discarded by researchers. We also observe that the recalibration of mapping quality scores greatly enhances the precision of called single nucleotide polymorphisms.Availability: LoQuM is available as open source at http://compbio.case.edu/loqum/.Contact:matthew.ruffalo@case.edu.},

  abstract     = {MOTIVATION: The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques presents many novel opportunities for many applications in life sciences. The vast number of short reads produced by these techniques, however, pose significant computational challenges. The first step in many types of genomic analysis is the mapping of short reads to a reference genome, and several groups have developed dedicated algorithms and software packages to perform this function. As the developers of these packages optimize their algorithms with respect to various considerations, the relative merits of different software packages remain unclear. However, for scientists who generate and use NGS data for their specific research projects, an important consideration is choosing the software that is most suitable for their application. RESULTS: With a view to comparing existing short read alignment software, we develop a simulation and evaluation suite, Seal, which simulates NGS runs for different configurations of various factors, including sequencing error, indels and coverage. We also develop criteria to compare the performances of software with disparate output structure (e.g. some packages return a single alignment while some return multiple possible alignments). Using these criteria, we comprehensively evaluate the performances of Bowtie, BWA, mr- and mrsFAST, Novoalign, SHRiMP and SOAPv2, with regard to accuracy and runtime. CONCLUSION: We expect that the results presented here will be useful to investigators in choosing the alignment software that is most suitable for their specific research aims. Our results also provide insights into the factors that should be considered to use alignment results effectively. Seal can also be used to evaluate the performance of algorithms that use deep sequencing data for various purposes (e.g. identification of genomic variants).

@article{sahlinEffectiveSequenceSimilarity2021,
  abstract     = {k-mer-based methods are widely used in bioinformatics for various types of sequence comparisons. However, a single mutation will mutate k consecutive k-mers and make most k-mer-based applications for sequence comparison sensitive to variable mutation rates. Many techniques have been studied to overcome this sensitivity, for example, spaced k-mers and k-mer permutation techniques, but these techniques do not handle indels well. For indels, pairs or groups of small k-mers are commonly used, but these methods first produce k-mer matches, and only in a second step, a pairing or grouping of k-mers is performed. Such techniques produce many redundant k-mer matches owing to the size of k. Here, we propose strobemers as an alternative to k-mers for sequence comparison. Intuitively, strobemers consist of two or more linked shorter k-mers, where the combination of linked k-mers is decided by a hash function. We use simulated data to show that strobemers provide more evenly distributed sequence matches and are less sensitive to different mutation rates than k-mers and spaced k-mers. Strobemers also produce higher match coverage across sequences. We further implement a proof-of-concept sequence-matching tool StrobeMap and use synthetic and biological Oxford Nanopore sequencing data to show the utility of using strobemers for sequence comparison in different contexts such as sequence clustering and alignment scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Oxford Nanopore (ONT) is a leading long-read technology which has been revolutionizing transcriptome analysis through its capacity to sequence the majority of transcripts from end-to-end. This has greatly increased our ability to study the diversity of transcription mechanisms such as transcription initiation, termination, and alternative splicing. However, ONT still suffers from high error rates which have thus far limited its scope to reference-based analyses. When a reference is not available or is not a viable option due to reference-bias, error correction is a crucial step towards the reconstruction of the sequenced transcripts and downstream sequence analysis of transcripts. In this paper, we present a novel computational method to error correct ONT cDNA sequencing data, called isONcorrect. IsONcorrect is able to jointly use all isoforms from a gene during error correction, thereby allowing it to correct reads at low sequencing depths. We are able to obtain a median accuracy of 98.9–99.6\%, demonstrating the feasibility of applying cost-effective cDNA full transcript length sequencing for reference-free transcriptome analysis.},

  abstract  = {Read alignment to genomes is a fundamental computational step used in many bioinformatic analyses, and often, it is the computational bottleneck. Therefore, it is desirable to perform the alignment step as fast as possible without compromising accuracy. Most alignment algorithms consider a seed-and-extend approach, where the time-consuming seeding step identifies and decides on candidate mapping locations. Recently, several advances have been made on seeding methods for fast sequence comparison. We combine two such methods, syncmers and strobemers, in a novel seeding approach for constructing dynamic-sized fuzzy seeds and implement the method in a short-read aligner, strobealign. Firstly, we show that our seeding is fast to construct and effectively reduces repetitiveness in the seeding step using a novel metric E-hits. Secondly, we benchmark strobealign to traditional and recently proposed aligners on simulated and biological data and show that strobealign is several times faster than traditional aligners such as BWA and Bowtie2 at similar and sometimes higher accuracy while being both faster and more accurate than more recently proposed aligners. Our aligner can free up substantial time and computing resources needed for read alignment in many pipelines. Availability https://github.com/ksahlin/strobealign.},

However, current de novo transcript reconstruction algorithms from long-read data are limited, leaving the potential of these technologies unfulfilled. A common bottleneck is the dearth of scalable and accurate algorithms for clustering long reads according to their gene family of origin. To address this challenge, we develop isONclust, a clustering algorithm that is greedy (to scale) and makes use of quality values (to handle variable error rates). We test isONclust on three simulated and five biological data sets, across a breadth of organisms, technologies, and read depths. Our results demonstrate that isONclust is a substantial improvement over previous approaches, both in terms of overall accuracy and/or scalability to large data sets.},

The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method.

Errors include numerous indels and complicate downstream analysis like mapping or de novo assembly. A hybrid strategy that takes advantage of the high accuracy of second-generation short reads has been proposed for correcting long reads. Mapping of short reads on long reads provides sufficient coverage to eliminate up to 99\% of errors, however, at the expense of prohibitive running times and considerable amounts of disk and memory space. Results : We present LoRDEC, a hybrid error correction method that builds a succinct de Bruijn graph representing the short reads, and seeks a corrective sequence for each erroneous region in the long reads by traversing chosen paths in the graph.

@misc{sandersonComparisonR9Kit102022,
  abstract  = {2. Abstract Complete, accurate, cost-effective, and high-throughput reconstruction of bacterial genomes for large-scale genomic epidemiological studies is currently only possible with hybrid assembly, combining long- (typically using nanopore sequencing) and short-read (Illumina) datasets. Being able to utilise nanopore-only data would be a significant advance. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have recently released a new flowcell (R10.4) and chemistry (Kit12), which reportedly generate per-read accuracies rivalling those of Illumina data. To evaluate this, we sequenced DNA extracts from four commonly studied bacterial pathogens, namely Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, using Illumina and ONT’s R9.4.1/Kit10, R10.3/Kit12, R10.4/Kit12 flowcells/chemistries. We compared raw read accuracy and assembly accuracy for each modality, considering the impact of different nanopore basecalling models, commonly used assemblers, sequencing depth, and the use of duplex versus simplex reads. “Super accuracy” (sup) basecalled R10.4 reads - in particular duplex reads - have high per-read accuracies and could be used to robustly reconstruct bacterial genomes without the use of Illumina data. However, the per-run yield of duplex reads generated in our hands with standard sequencing protocols was low (typically {$<$}10\%), with substantial implications for cost and throughput if relying on nanopore data only to enable bacterial genome reconstruction. In addition, recovery of small plasmids with the best-performing long-read assembler (Flye) was inconsistent. R10.4/Kit12 combined with sup basecalling holds promise as a singular sequencing technology in the reconstruction of commonly studied bacterial genomes, but hybrid assembly (Illumina+R9.4.1 hac) currently remains the highest throughput, most robust, and cost-effective approach to fully reconstruct these bacterial genomes. Impact statement Our understanding of microbes has been greatly enhanced by the capacity to evaluate their genetic make-up using a technology known as whole genome sequencing. Sequencers represent microbial genomes as stretches of shorter sequence known as ‘reads’, which are then assembled using computational algorithms. Different types of sequencing approach have advantages and disadvantages with respect to the accuracy and length of the reads they generate; this in turn affects how reliably genomes can be assembled.Currently, to completely reconstruct bacterial genomes in a high-throughput and cost-effective manner, researchers tend to use two different types of sequencing data, namely Illumina (short-read) and nanopore (long-read) data. Illumina data are highly accurate; nanopore data are much longer, and this combination facilitates accurate and complete bacterial genomes in a so-called “hybrid assembly”. However, new developments in nanopore sequencing have reportedly greatly improved the accuracy of nanopore data, hinting at the possibility of requiring only a single sequencing approach for bacterial genomics.Here we evaluate these improvements in nanopore sequencing in the reconstruction of four bacterial reference strains, where the true sequence is already known. We show that although these improvements are extremely promising, for high-throughput, low-cost complete reconstruction of bacterial genomes hybrid assembly currently remains the optimal approach.

  abstract     = {An extended spectrum of HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase (RT) mutations in HAART-treated patients has been recently described. To verify the possible association of previously unreported RT mutations with a decrease of phenotypic susceptibility to nucleoside (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside (NNRTIs) RT inhibitors, the RT sequence of 328 HIV-1-positive patients (102 na\"ive and 226 treated with HAART participating in either the PhenGen or Genpherex study) was analyzed. All treated patients were tested at the time of therapeutic failure with both phenotypic (Antivirogram\textregistered, Virco) and genotypic analyses (VircoGen\texttrademark ); the frequency of RT substitutions (positions 1\textendash 240) with respect to consensus B was compared to that of na\"ive patients using a Chi-square test. Amino acid changes at 13 positions not included in the IAS list of resistance-associated mutations were detected more frequently in treated than in na\"ive subjects. The mutations involving 10 of these positions were associated with a reduced susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs; K20R, T39A, K43EQN, E203KD, H208Y, and D218E were correlated with NRTI resistance while mutations K101EQP, H221Y, K223EQ, L228HR were associated to NNRTI resistance. A correlation was found between K20R and lamivudine resistance (P = 0.006) while T39A (P = 0.005), K43EQN ({$<$}0.001), E203KD (P = 0.010), and H208Y (P = {$<$} 0.001) seemed to be associated with a previous use of zidovudine and stavudine and with the development of thymidine analog resistance. For H208Y, an association with use/resistance to abacavir (P = 0.004) was also noted. D218E showed a weak association to didanosine resistance (P = 0.013).

  abstract     = {An important component of triple-drug anti-AIDS therapy is 2', 3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC, lamivudine). Single mutations at residue 184 of the reverse transcriptase (RT) in HIV cause high-level resistance to 3TC and contribute to the failure of anti-AIDS combination therapy. We have determined crystal structures of the 3TC-resistant mutant HIV-1 RT (M184I) in both the presence and absence of a DNA/DNA template-primer. In the absence of a DNA substrate, the wild-type and mutant structures are very similar. However, comparison of crystal structures of M184I mutant and wild-type HIV-1 RT with and without DNA reveals repositioning of the template-primer in the M184I/DNA binary complex and other smaller changes in residues in the dNTP-binding site. On the basis of these structural results, we developed a model that explains the ability of the 3TC-resistant mutant M184I to incorporate dNTPs but not the nucleotide analog 3TCTP. In this model, steric hindrance is expected for NRTIs with beta- or L- ring configurations, as with the enantiomer of 3TC that is used in therapy. Steric conflict between the oxathiolane ring of 3TCTP and the side chain of beta-branched amino acids (Val, Ile, Thr) at position 184 perturbs inhibitor binding, leading to a reduction in incorporation of the analog. The model can also explain the 3TC resistance of analogous hepatitis B polymerase mutants. Repositioning of the template-primer as observed in the binary complex (M184I/DNA) may also occur in the catalytic ternary complex (M184I/DNA/3TCTP) and contribute to 3TC resistance by interfering with the formation of a catalytically competent closed complex.},

In the absence of an effective vaccine, drugs are the only useful treatment. Anti-HIV drugs work; so far drug therapy has saved more than three million years of life. Unfortunately, HIV-1 develops resistance to all of the available drugs. Although a number of useful anti-HIV drugs have been approved for use in patients, the problems associated with drug toxicity and the development of resistance means that the search for new drugs is an ongoing process. The three viral enzymes, reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN), and protease (PR) are all good drug targets. Two distinct types of RT inhibitors, both of which block the polymerase activity of RT, have been approved to treat HIV-1 infections, nucleoside analogs (NRTIs) and nonnucleosides (NNRTIs), and there are promising leads for compounds that either block the RNase H activity or block the polymerase in other ways. A better understanding of the structure and function(s) of RT and of the mechanism(s) of inhibition can be used to generate better drugs; in particular drugs that are effective against the current drug-resistant strains of HIV-1.},

The statistical characterization of gapped alignment scores has been a long-standing problem in sequence alignment research. Using a variant of the directed path in random media model, we investigate the score statistics of global sequence alignment taking into account, in particular, the compositional bias of the sequences compared. Such statistics are used to distinguish accidental similarity due to compositional similarity from biologically significant similarity. To accommodate the compositional bias, we introduce an extra parameter p indicating the probability for positive matching scores to occur. When p is small, a high scoring alignment obviously cannot come from compositional similarity. When p is large, the highest scoring point within a global alignment tends to be close to the end of both sequences, in which case we say the system percolates. By applying finite-size scaling theory on percolating probability functions of various sizes (sequence lengths), the critical p at infinite size is obtained. For alignment of length t, the fact that the score fluctuation grows as chi(t)1/3 is confirmed upon investigating the scaling form of the alignment score. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics test, we show that the random variable , if properly scaled, follows the Tracy-Widom distributions: Gaussian orthogonal ensemble for p slightly larger than pc and Gaussian unitary ensemble for larger p. Although these results deepen our understanding of the distribution of alignment scores, the use of these results in practical applications remains somewhat heuristic and needs to be further developed. Nevertheless, the possibility of characterizing score statistics for modest system size (sequence lengths), via proper reparametrization of alignment scores, is illustrated.},

The error rate of the platform is higher than most mature next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, with many of the deletions accumulating in stretches of identical bases (homopolymers). However, the mean time each 5-base long subsequence (k-mer) of the molecule spends inside of the pore (dwell time) can also be used to infer the length of the true sequence. We developed a method called NanoTimer, which estimates the homopolymer length from the dwell times. It relies on the redundancy of having multiple reads covering a reference sequence, and the depth of coverage determines its accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Inferring epidemiological parameters such as the R0 from time-scaled phylogenies is a timely challenge. Most current approaches rely on likelihood functions, which raise specific issues that range from computing these functions to finding their maxima numerically. Here, we present a new regression-based Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach, which we base on a large variety of summary statistics intended to capture the information contained in the phylogeny and its corresponding lineage-through-time plot. The regression step involves the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method, which is a robust machine learning technique. It allows us to readily deal with the large number of summary statistics, while avoiding resorting to Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. To compare our approach to existing ones, we simulated target trees under a variety of epidemiological models and settings, and inferred parameters of interest using the same priors. We found that, for large phylogenies, the accuracy of our regression-ABC is comparable to that of likelihood-based approaches involving birth-death processes implemented in BEAST2. Our approach even outperformed these when inferring the host population size with a Susceptible-Infected-Removed epidemiological model. It also clearly outperformed a recent kernel-ABC approach when assuming a Susceptible-Infected epidemiological model with two host types. Lastly, by re-analyzing data from the early stages of the recent Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, we showed that regression-ABC provides more realistic estimates for the duration parameters (latency and infectiousness) than the likelihood-based method. Overall, ABC based on a large variety of summary statistics and a regression method able to perform variable selection and avoid overfitting is a promising approach to analyze large phylogenies.},

@article{savoretPilotStudyHumoral2020,
  abstract     = {The existence of an antisense Open Reading Frame (ORF) that encodes a putative AntiSense Protein (ASP) on the proviral genome of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) was a source of debate for 30 years. During the last years, some progresses have been made to characterize the cellular immune response against ASP in HIV-1 seropositive patients. However, no tools were available for the detection of antibodies to ASP in the plasma of HIV-1-infected patients during the natural course of the infection. The aim of our study was to develop a Luciferase Immuno-Precipitation System (LIPS) to monitor the quantitative detection of ASP-specific antibodies in the plasma of HIV-1-infected patients [antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive-patients, patients under ART and HIV-1 controllers], patients who discontinued antiretroviral drugs (ARV). We further used this approach to delineate the epitopes of ASP targeted by antibodies. Antibodies directed against ASP were detected in 3 out of 19 patients who discontinued ARV (15\%) and in 1 out of 10 ART-naive patients (10\%), but were neither detected in HIV-1 infected patients under ART nor in HIV-1 controllers. Individual variations in levels of ASP-specific antibodies were detected overtime. Both the conserved prolin-rich motif and the core 60–189 region of ASP were found to be essential for antibody recognition in the four patients tested positive for anti-ASP antibodies, who were all untreated at the time of sampling. Moreover, for two of these patients, increased levels of ASP-specific antibodies were observed concomitantly to viremia declines. Overall, our method may represent a useful tool to detect a humoral response to ASP in HIV-1-infected patients, which allowed us to confirm the expression of ASP during the course of HIV-1 infection. Further studies will be needed to fully characterize the humoral response to ASP in HIV-1-infected patients.},

@article{scarsiHIV1IntegraseInhibitors2020,
  abstract     = {The newest class of antiretrovirals for all persons living with HIV are the integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Since 2007, five INSTIs have been introduced: raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir, bictegravir, and cabotegravir. The INSTIs have favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, which contribute to both their effectiveness and ease of use. With the exception of cabotegravir, each INSTI is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for treatment-naïve individuals initiating antiretroviral therapy. All of the INSTIs, except raltegravir, are approved for antiretroviral treatment simplification for virologically suppressed patients without INSTI resistance. Data also support the use of dolutegravir and raltegravir in individuals with antiretroviral resistance as part of an optimized antiretroviral regimen. INSTIs are generally well tolerated by people living with HIV compared with older classes of antiretrovirals, but emerging data suggest that some INSTIs contribute to weight gain. Due to their efficacy, safety, and ease of use, HIV treatment guidelines recommend oral INSTIs as preferred components of antiretroviral therapy for individuals initiating therapy. The newest INSTI, cabotegravir, represents an alternative to oral administration of life-long antiretroviral therapy with the availability of a long acting injectable formulation. This review summarizes the current use of INSTIs in adults living with HIV, highlighting the similarities and differences within the class related to pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety, dosing and administration that contribute to their role in modern antiretroviral therapy.},

In this article, we first review the underlying algorithms used in most of the existing mapping tools, and then we compare the performance of nine of these tools on a well controled benchmark built for this purpose. We built a set of reads that exist in single or multiple copies in a reference genome and for which there is no mismatch, and a set of reads with three mismatches. We considered as reference genome both the human genome and a concatenation of all complete bacterial genomes. On each dataset, we quantified the capacity of the different tools to retrieve all the occurrences of the reads in the reference genome. Special attention was paid to reads uniquely reported and to reads with multiple hits.},

@article{schneiderEmpiricalCodonSubstitution2005,
  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Codon substitution probabilities are used in many types of molecular evolution studies such as determining Ka/Ks ratios, creating ancestral DNA sequences or aligning coding DNA. Until the recent dramatic increase in genomic data enabled construction of empirical matrices, researchers relied on parameterized models of codon evolution. Here we present the first empirical codon substitution matrix entirely built from alignments of coding sequences from vertebrate DNA and thus provide an alternative to parameterized models of codon evolution. RESULTS: A set of 17,502 alignments of orthologous sequences from five vertebrate genomes yielded 8.3 million aligned codons from which the number of substitutions between codons were counted. From this data, both a probability matrix and a matrix of similarity scores were computed. They are 64 x 64 matrices describing the substitutions between all codons. Substitutions from sense codons to stop codons are not considered, resulting in block diagonal matrices consisting of 61 x 61 entries for the sense codons and 3 x 3 entries for the stop codons. CONCLUSION: The amount of genomic data currently available allowed for the construction of an empirical codon substitution matrix. However, more sequence data is still needed to construct matrices from different subsets of DNA, specific to kingdoms, evolutionary distance or different amount of synonymous change. Codon mutation matrices have advantages for alignments up to medium evolutionary distances and for usages that require DNA such as ancestral reconstruction of DNA sequences and the calculation of Ka/Ks ratios.},

We have implemented standard maximum likelihood methods that are used to detect diversifying selection and adapted them for use with serially sampled reverse transcriptase (RT) coding sequences isolated from a group of 300 HIV-1 subtype C–infected women before and after single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP) to prevent mother-to-child transmission. We have also extended the standard models of codon evolution for application to the detection of directional selection. Through simulation, we show that the directional selection model can provide a substantial improvement in sensitivity over models of diversifying selection. Five of the sites within the RT gene that are known to harbor mutations that confer resistance to nevirapine (NVP) strongly supported the directional selection model. There was no evidence that other mutations that are known to confer NVP resistance were selected in this cohort. The directional selection model, applied to serially sampled sequences, also had more power than the diversifying selection model to detect selection resulting from factors other than drug resistance. Because inference of selection from serial samples is unlikely to be adversely affected by recombination, the methods we describe may have general applicability to the analysis of positive selection affecting recombining coding sequences when serially sampled data are available.},

Given a protein sequence as input, the model is trained to predict a pairwise coupling matrix for a Potts model energy function describing the local evolutionary landscape of the sequence. Couplings can be predicted for novel sequences.

  abstract  = {We review the approaches that model a set of Attributed Graphs (AGs) by extending the definition of AGs to include probabilistic information. As a main result, we present a quite general formulation for estimating the joint probability distribution of the random elements of a set of AGs, in which some degree of probabilistic independence between random elements is assumed, by considering only 2nd-order joint probabilities and marginal ones. We show that the two previously proposed approaches based on the random-graph representation (First-Order Random Graphs (FORGs) and Function-Described Graphs (FDGs)) can be seen as two different approximations of the general formulation presented. From this new representation, it is easy to derive that whereas FORGs contain some more semantic (partial) 2nd-order information, FDGs contain more structural 2nd-order information of the whole set of AGs. Most importantly, the presented formulation opens the door to the development of new and more powerful probabilistic representations of sets of AGs based on the 2nd-order random graph concept.},

Shasta produced a complete haploid human genome assembly in under 6\,h on a single commercial compute node. MarginPolish and HELEN polished haploid assemblies to more than 99.9\% identity (Phred quality score QV\,=\,30) with nanopore reads alone. Addition of proximity-ligation sequencing enabled near chromosome-level scaffolds for all 11 genomes.

Accordingly, we compared the prevalences of protease and RT mutations in HIV-1 group M sequences from individuals with and without a history of previous treatment with protease inhibitors (PIs) or RT inhibitors (RTIs). Mutations in protease sequences from 26,888 individuals and in RT sequences from 25,695 individuals were classified according to whether they were nonpolymorphic in untreated individuals and whether their prevalence increased fivefold with ARV therapy. This analysis showed that 88 PI-selected and 122 RTI-selected nonpolymorphic mutations had a prevalence that was fivefold higher in individuals receiving ARVs than in ARV-naïve individuals. This was an increase of 47\% and 77\%, respectively, compared with the 60 PI- and 69 RTI-selected mutations identified in a similar analysis that we published in 2005 using subtype B sequences obtained from one-fourth as many individuals. In conclusion, many nonpolymorphic mutations in protease and RT are under ARV selection pressure. The spectrum of treatment-selected mutations is changing as data for more individuals are collected, treatment exposures change, and the number of available sequences from non-subtype B viruses increases.},

Here, we describe the origins and evolution of these viruses, and the circumstances that led to the AIDS pandemic. Both HIVs are the result of multiple cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) naturally infecting African primates. Most of these transfers resulted in viruses that spread in humans to only a limited extent. However, one transmission event, involving SIVcpz from chimpanzees in southeastern Cameroon, gave rise to HIV-1 group M—the principal cause of the AIDS pandemic. We discuss how host restriction factors have shaped the emergence of new SIV zoonoses by imposing adaptive hurdles to cross-species transmission and/or secondary spread. We also show that AIDS has likely afflicted chimpanzees long before the emergence of HIV. Tracing the genetic changes that occurred as SIVs crossed from monkeys to apes and from apes to humans provides a new framework to examine the requirements of successful host switches and to gauge future zoonotic risk., Approximately one century ago in southeastern Cameroon, cross-species transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees gave rise to HIV-1 group M, the principal cause of the AIDS pandemic in humans.},

  abstract     = {HIV-1 is transmitted by sexual contact across mucosal surfaces, by maternal-infant exposure, and by percutaneous inoculation. For reasons that are still incompletely understood, CCR5-tropic viruses (R5 viruses) are preferentially transmitted by all routes. Transmission is followed by an orderly appearance of viral and host markers of infection in the blood plasma. In the acute phase of infection, HIV-1 replicates exponentially and diversifies randomly, allowing for an unambiguous molecular identification of transmitted/founder virus genomes and a precise characterization of the population bottleneck to virus transmission. Sexual transmission of HIV-1 most often results in productive clinical infection arising from a single virus, highlighting the extreme bottleneck and inherent inefficiency in virus transmission. It remains to be determined if HIV-1 transmission is largely a stochastic process whereby any reasonably fit R5 virus can be transmitted or if there are features of transmitted/founder viruses that facilitate their transmission in a biologically meaningful way. Human tissue explant models of HIV-1 infection and animal models of SIV/SHIV/HIV-1 transmission, coupled with new challenge virus strains that more closely reflect transmitted/founder viruses, have the potential to elucidate fundamental mechanisms in HIV-1 transmission relevant to vaccine design and other prevention strategies.},

Here, using a large-scale meta-transcriptomic approach, we discover 214 vertebrate-associated viruses in reptiles, amphibians, lungfish, ray-finned fish, cartilaginous fish and jawless fish. The newly discovered viruses appear in every family or genus of RNA virus associated with vertebrate infection, including those containing human pathogens such as influenza virus, the Arenaviridae and Filoviridae families, and have branching orders that broadly reflected the phylogenetic history of their hosts. We establish a long evolutionary history for most groups of vertebrate RNA virus, and support this by evaluating evolutionary timescales using dated orthologous endogenous virus elements. We also identify new vertebrate-specific RNA viruses and genome architectures, and re-evaluate the evolution of vector-borne RNA viruses. In summary, this study reveals diverse virus–host associations across the entire evolutionary history of the vertebrates.},

  abstract     = {To predict the functions of a possible protein product of any new or uncharacterized DNA sequence, it is important first to detect all significant similarities between the encoded amino acid sequence and any accumulated protein sequence data. We have implemented a set of queries and database sequences and proceeded to test and compare various similarity search methods and their parameterizations. We demonstrate here that the Smith–Waterman (S-W) dynamic programming method and the optimized version of FASTA are significantly better able to distinguish true similarities from statistical noise than is the popular database search tool BLAST. Also, a simple “log-length normalization” of S-W scores based on the query and target sequence lengths greatly increased the selectivity of the S-W searches, exceeding the default normalization method of FASTA. An implementation of the modified S-W algorithm in hardware (the Fast Data Finder) is able to match the accuracy of software versions while greatly speeding up its execution. We present here the selectivity and sensitivity data from these tests as well as results for various scoring matrices. We present data that will help users to choose threshold score values for evaluation of database search results. We also illustrate the impact of using simple-sequence masking tools such as SEG or XNU.},

NNRTI hypersusceptibility has been associated with improved outcomes to NNRTI-based therapy.         Objective:~         To determine the genetic correlates of efavirenz hypersusceptibility.         Methods:~         Paired baseline genotypes and phenotypes were obtained from 444 NRTI-experienced, NNRTI-naive patients. Fisher's exact tests, recursive partitioning (classification and regression trees; CART), and stepwise binary regression were used to identify specific reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations associated with efavirenz hypersusceptibility.         Results:~         In univariate analyses, 26 RT codons were associated with efavirenz hypersusceptibility (P {$<$} 0.05), the top five were 215 {$>$} 41 {$>$} 210 {$>$} 118 {$>$} 208 (all P {$<$} 0.000001). From stepwise model selection, the 215, 208 and 118 mutations remained independently predictive of efavirenz hypersusceptibility. A final binary regression model to predict efavirenz hypersusceptibility included one covariate for the 215 mutation (relative risk 2.6, P {$<$} 0.0001) and a second covariate representing either the 208 or 118 mutation (relative risk 1.8, P {$<$} 0.0001). Similarly, in a CART analysis, a mutation at codon 215 was the first split selected, followed by mutations at 208 and 118. An efavirenz hypersusceptibility genotypic score using the three mutations 208, 118 and 215 was as accurate at predicting efavirenz hypersusceptibility as a more complex scoring system using 26 mutations.         Conclusion:~         Mutations at 215, 208 and 118 were independently associated with NNRTI hypersusceptibility. After confirmatory studies using other large datasets, incorporating a hypersusceptibility score into genotype interpretation algorithms will improve the prediction of NNRTI hypersusceptibility.},

These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

@article{silvaInhibitionCatalyticMechanism1996,
  abstract     = {The structure of the HIV-1 protease in complex with a pseudo-C2 symmetric inhibitor, which contains a central difluoroketone motif, has been determined with X-ray diffraction data extending to 1.7 Å resolution. The electron density map clearly indicates that the inhibitor is bound in a symmetric fashion as the hydrated, or gemdiol, form of the difluoroketone. Refinement of the complex reveals a unique, and almost symmetric, set of interactions between the geminal hydroxyl groups, the geminal fluorine atoms, and the active-site aspartate residues. Several hydrogen bonding patterns are consistent with that conformation. The lowest energy hydrogen disposition, as determined by semiempirical energy calculations, shows only one active site aspartate protonated. A comparison between the corresponding dihedral angles of the difluorodiol core and those of a hydrated peptide bond analog, calculated ab-initio, shows that the inhibitor core is a mimic of a hydrated peptide bond in a gauche conformation. The feasibility of an anti-gauche transition for a peptide bond after hydration is verified by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations suggest that rotation about the C-N scissile bond would readily occur after hydration and would be driven by the optimization of the interactions of peptide side-chains with the enzyme. These results, together with the characterization of a transition state leading to bond breakage via a concerted exchange of two protons, suggest a proteolysis mechanism whereby only one active site aspartate is initially protonated. The steps of this mechanism are: asymmetric binding of the substrate; hydration of the peptidic carbonyl by an active site water; proton translocation between the active site aspartate residues simultaneously with carbonyl hydration; optimization of the binding of the entire substrate facilitated by the flexible structure of the hydrated peptide bond, which, in turn, forces the hydrated peptide bond to assume a gauche conformation; simultaneous proton exchange whereby one hydroxyl donates a proton to the charged aspartate, and, at the same time, the nitrogen lone pair accepts a proton from the other aspartate; and, bond breakage and regeneration of the initial protonation state of the aspartate residues.},

  abstract     = {“What I cannot create, I do not understand.” Richard Feynman may have championed reasoning from first principles in his famous blackboard missive, but he could just as well have been referring to the plight of a molecular virologist. What cannot be grown in a controlled laboratory setting, we cannot fully understand. The story of the laboratory domestication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is now a classic example of virologists applying all manner of inventive skill to create cell-based models of infection in order to clarify prospective drug targets. In this review, we highlight key successes and failures that were instructive in achieving cell-based models for HCV studies and drug development. We also emphasize the lessons learned from the ∼40 year saga that may be applicable to viruses yet unknown and uncultured. Simeprevir (Olysio®), a second-wave protease inhibitor recently approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, is not indicated in patients with genotype 1a strain harboring the Q80K protease mutation. Phase 2 and 3 studies on this molecule mainly focused on North American patients and the prevalence of Q80K is particularly high in the USA (around 50\%). The prevalence of this mutation in other parts of the world is currently unknown. The purpose of our study was to perform a detection of this mutation in a single PCR technique and to study the prevalence of this Q80K mutation in a non U.S. population. We can thus estimate the proportion of HCV positive patients who can be treated with simeprevir. We conducted a meta-analysis of response rates in the presence or absence of this mutation in randomized trials and then describe a simple and reliable method to detect this mutation. We also examined bilirubin levels in our cohort of 95 HCV genotype 1a patients. Ten patients (10.5\%) had a Q80K mutation and 12 patients exhibited bilirubin levels above the upper limit of normal at baseline. In our cohort, 21 patients (22\%) were therefore ineligible for treatment with simeprevir. The prevalence of this mutation seems to be much lower in European patients. In conclusion, before considering treatment with simeprevir, physicians must be able to screen for the Q80K mutation. The adaptation of the overall codon usage pattern of hepatitis C virus (HCV) to that of human is estimated by the synonymous codon usage value (RSCU). The synonymous codon usage biases for the translation initiation region (TIR) of this virus are also analyzed by calculation of usage fluctuation of each synonymous codon along the TIR (the first 30 codon sites of the whole coding sequence of HCV). As for the overall codon usage pattern of HCV, this virus has a significant tendency to delete the codons with CpG or TpA dinucleotides. Turning to the adaptation of the overall codon usage of HCV to that of human, over half part of codons has a similar usage pattern between this virus and human, suggesting that the host cellular environment of the overall codon usage pattern influences the formation of codon usage for HCV. In addition, there is no obvious phenomenon that the codons with relatively low energy tend to be highly selected in the TIR of HCV, suggesting that the synonymous codon usage patterns for the TIR of HCV might be not affected by the secondary structure of nucleotide sequence, however, the formation of synonymous codons usage in the TIR of HCV is influenced by the overall codon usage patterns of human to some degree.},

Novel mutations in the HIV genome associated with treatment failure were identified by mining a relational clinical database. Hierarchical cluster analysis suggests that two of these mutations form a novel mutational complex, while all others are involved in known resistance-conferring evolutionary pathways. The clustering is shown to be highly stable in a bootstrap procedure. Multidimensional scaling in mutation space indicates that certain mutations can occur within multiple pathways. Feature ranking based on support vector machines and matched genotype-phenotype pairs comprehensively reproduces current domain knowledge. Moreover, it indicates a prominent role of novel mutations in determining phenotypic resistance and in resensitization effects. These effects may be exploited deliberately to reopen lost treatment options. Together, these findings provide valuable insight into the interpretation of genotypic resistance tests.},

  abstract     = {HIV-1 protease site helps to understand the specificity of substrates which antagonizes AIDS by restraining the replication of HIV-1 through inhibitors. Identification of HIV-1 protease cleavage sites by experimental methods are usually labor-intensive thus time-consuming. Several computational intelligence methods have been evaluated to predict cleavage sites. However, due to inconsistent findings regarding the superiority of one classifier over another and the usefulness of encoding techniques in general, more research is needed to provide advance confidence in computational results. The success of an HIV cleavage site prediction system depends heavily on two things: the classifier being used and the features encoding technique applied. For the cleavage sites identification, the role of appropriate feature encoding has not been paid adequate importance. In this investigation, we use two novel ideas for HIV Cleavage site prediction. First, we propose an optimal ensemble formation technique that optimizes the search space of 228 formed by seven encoding techniques and four SVM kernels (7\,×\,4) with the use of genetic algorithm. The second is the utilization of area under receiver operating characteristics (AUC) as a fitness measure for the evaluation of optimal ensemble. The evolutionary algorithm is encoded with binary strings to decide the correlation between the encoding-classifier pair in an ensemble. The proposed method with new ensembling encoding-classifier pair increases the HIV cleavage site prediction significantly. Overall, an appealing degree of predictive accuracy is observed by evolutionary-based ensemble model and hence becomes a valid and best alternative for peptide classification.},

We introduce MSA-ED, a machine learning tool for the detection of errors in whole-genome multiple alignments. MSA-ED uses random forests or artificial neural networks to identify and classify several types of alignment errors. It is trained on labeled data obtained by using an evolution simulator to generate fake orthologous sequences and their correct alignment, and comparing it to the alignment produced by Multiz, a popular whole-genome aligner. Key to the success of MSA-ED is the engineering of several types of evolutionarily-inspired features that boost prediction accuracy. MSA-ED is shown to be able to detect certain types of errors with good accuracy. It is then applied to actual genomic alignments to identify putative alignment errors.},

  abstract     = {Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine, 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine and 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine, are effective inhibitors of human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) replication. NRTIs are deoxynucleoside triphosphate analogs, but lack a free 3′-hydroxyl group. Once NRTIs are incorporated into the nascent viral DNA, in reactions catalyzed by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), further viral DNA synthesis is effectively terminated. NRTIs should therefore represent the ideal antiviral agent. Unfortunately, HIV-1 inevitably develops resistance to these inhibitors, and this resistance correlates with mutations in RT. To date, three phenotypic mechanisms have been identified or proposed to account for HIV-1 RT resistance to NRTIs. These mechanisms include alterations of RT discrimination between NRTIs and the analogous dNTP (direct effects on NRTI binding and/or incorporation), alterations in RT-template/primer interactions, which may influence subsequent NRTI incorporation, and enhanced removal of the chain-terminating residue from the 3′ end of the primer. These different resistance phenotypes seem to correlate with different sets of mutations in RT. This review discusses the relationship between HIV-1 drug resistance genotype and phenotype, in relation to our current knowledge of HIV-1 RT structure.},

  abstract     = {The estimation of large multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) is a basic bioinformatics challenge. Divide-and-conquer is a useful approach that has been shown to improve the scalability and accuracy of MSA estimation in established methods such as SATé and PASTA. In these divide-and-conquer strategies, a sequence dataset is divided into disjoint subsets, alignments are computed on the subsets using base MSA methods (e.g. MAFFT), and then merged together into an alignment on the full dataset.We present MAGUS, Multiple sequence Alignment using Graph clUStering, a new technique for computing large-scale alignments. MAGUS is similar to PASTA in that it uses nearly the same initial steps (starting tree, similar decomposition strategy, and MAFFT to compute subset alignments), but then merges the subset alignments using the Graph Clustering Merger, a new method for combining disjoint alignments that we present in this study. Our study, on a heterogeneous collection of biological and simulated datasets, shows that MAGUS produces improved accuracy and is faster than PASTA on large datasets, and matches it on smaller datasets.MAGUS: https://github.com/vlasmirnov/MAGUSSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{smithIdentificationCommonMolecular1981,
  abstract     = {Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction performs a crucial part in drug discovery and design. Although many computational approaches for such prediction have been proposed, current researches still generally adopt chemical similarities of drugs or the sequence similarities of targets. However, the valuable information of known interactions has not been noticed, and the existing noise and useless information reduce the accuracy of DTI prediction. In addition, many existing computational approaches ignore the behavior information between nodes of the DTI network. In this paper, we develop an ensemble computational approach called integrated multi-similarity fusion and heterogeneous graph inference. First, based on the known DTI network, the degree distribution of drug and target similarities are analyzed and the noise and useless information are removed to improve prediction accuracy. Second, based on drug and target similarities and known DTIs, a strategy of multi-similarity fusion is proposed to capture potential useful information from known interactions that is used for enhancing drug and target similarities. Third, the heterogeneous graph inference is used to predict the DTIs to capture the edge weight (closeness) and behavior information (diffusion) between nodes of a heterogeneous network. To assist the reproducibility of our work and its comparison to published results, we perform experiments on four benchmark datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms some existing approaches and can contribute to predicting potential DTIs. The fundamental role of microRNAs (miRNAs) has long been associated with regulation of gene expression during transcription and post transcription of mRNA's 3′UTR by the RNA interference mechanism. Also, the process of how miRNAs tend to induce mRNA degradation has been predominantly studied in many infectious diseases. In this article, we would like to discuss the interaction of dietary plant miRNAs derived from fresh fruits against the viral genome of the causative agent of COVID-19, specifically targeting the 3′UTR of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) genome. Expanding the analysis, we have also identified plant miRNAs that interact against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2 across 37 countries/territories throughout the world. This cross-species virus-plant interaction led us to identify the alignment of dietary plant miRNAs found in fruits like Citrus sinensis (Orange), Prunus persica (Peaches), Vitis vinifera (Grapes) and Malus domestica (Apple) onto the viral genomes. In particular, the interaction of C. sinensis miRNA - csi-miR169–3p and SARS-CoV-2 is noteworthy, as the targeted 3′UTR region “CTGCCT” is found conserved amongst all curated 772 Omicron variants across the globe. Hence this site “CTGCCT” and miRNA csi-miR169–3p may become promising therapeutic candidates to induce viral genome silencing. Thereby, this study reveals the mechanistic way of how fruits tend to enact a fight against viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and aid in maintaining a strong immune system of an individual. The reductive glycine pathway was described as the most energetically favorable synthetic route of aerobic formate assimilation. Here we report the successful implementation of formatotrophy in Escherichia coli by means of a stepwise adaptive evolution strategy. Medium swap and turbidostat regimes of continuous culture were applied to force the channeling of carbon flux through the synthetic pathway to pyruvate establishing growth on formate and CO2 as sole carbon sources. Labeling with 13C-formate proved the assimilation of the C1 substrate via the pathway metabolites. Genetic analysis of intermediate isolates revealed a mutational path followed throughout the adaptation process. Mutations were detected affecting the copy number (gene ftfL) or the coding sequence (genes folD and lpd) of genes which specify enzymes implicated in the three steps forming glycine from formate and CO2, the central metabolite of the synthetic pathway. The mutation R191S present in methylene-tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase (FolD) abolishes the inhibition of cyclohydrolase activity by the substrate formyl-tetrahydrofolate. The mutation R273H in lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd) alters substrate affinities as well as kinetics at physiological substrate concentrations likely favoring a reactional shift towards lipoamide reduction. In addition, genetic reconstructions proved the necessity of all three mutations for formate assimilation by the adapted cells. The largely unpredictable nature of these changes demonstrates the usefulness of the evolutionary approach enabling the selection of adaptive mutations crucial for pathway engineering of biotechnological model organisms. Expression of mRNA is often regulated by the binding of a small RNA (miRNA, snoRNA, siRNA). While the pairing contribution to the net free energy is well parameterized and can be computed in O(N){$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}O{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}N{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} time, the cost of removing pre-existing mRNA secondary structure has not received sufficient attention. Conventional methods for computing the unfolding free energy of a target mRNA are costly, scaling like the cube of the number of target bases O(N3){$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}O{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}N{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}3{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}. Here we introduce a model to describe the unfolding costs of the binding site, which features surprisingly big differences in the free energy parameters for the four bases. The model is implemented in our O(N){$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}O{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}N{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} algorithm, BindOligoNet. Donor splice site prediction is more accurate when using our calculation of spliceosomal U1-snRNA to mRNA net binding free energy. Our base-dependent free energies also correlate with efficient ribosome docking near the start codon.},

  abstract     = {MOTIVATION: Protein homology detection and sequence alignment are at the basis of protein structure prediction, function prediction and evolution. RESULTS: We have generalized the alignment of protein sequences with a profile hidden Markov model (HMM) to the case of pairwise alignment of profile HMMs. We present a method for detecting distant homologous relationships between proteins based on this approach. The method (HHsearch) is benchmarked together with BLAST, PSI-BLAST, HMMER and the profile-profile comparison tools PROF\_SIM and COMPASS, in an all-against-all comparison of a database of 3691 protein domains from SCOP 1.63 with pairwise sequence identities below 20\%.Sensitivity: When the predicted secondary structure is included in the HMMs, HHsearch is able to detect between 2.7 and 4.2 times more homologs than PSI-BLAST or HMMER and between 1.44 and 1.9 times more than COMPASS or PROF\_SIM for a rate of false positives of 10\%. Approximately half of the improvement over the profile-profile comparison methods is attributable to the use of profile HMMs in place of simple profiles. Alignment quality: Higher sensitivity is mirrored by an increased alignment quality. HHsearch produced 1.2, 1.7 and 3.3 times more good alignments ('balanced' score {$>$}0.3) than the next best method (COMPASS), and 1.6, 2.9 and 9.4 times more than PSI-BLAST, at the family, superfamily and fold level, respectively.Speed: HHsearch scans a query of 200 residues against 3691 domains in 33 s on an AMD64 2GHz PC. This is 10 times faster than PROF\_SIM and 17 times faster than COMPASS.},

In this review, we categorize de novo assemblers on the basis of the type of de Bruijn graphs (Hamiltonian and Eulerian) and discuss the challenges of de novo assembly for short NGS reads regarding computational complexity and assembly ambiguity. Then, we discuss how the limitations of the short reads can be overcome by using a single-molecule sequencing platform that generates long reads of up to several kilobases. In fact, the long read assembly has caused a paradigm shift in whole-genome assembly in terms of algorithms and supporting steps. We also summarize (i) hybrid assemblies using both short and long reads and (ii) overlap-based assemblies for long reads and discuss their challenges and future prospects. This review provides guidelines to determine the optimal approach for a given input data type, computational budget or genome.},

Pretraining models are used for embedding biological sequence and extracting feature from large biological sequence corpus to comprehensively understand the biological sequence data. In this survey, we provide a broad review on pretraining models for biological sequence data. Moreover, we first introduce biological sequences and corresponding datasets, including brief description and accessible link. Subsequently, we systematically summarize popular pretraining models for biological sequences based on four categories: CNN, word2vec, LSTM and Transformer. Then, we present some applications with proposed pretraining models on downstream tasks to explain the role of pretraining models.

Dynamic programming algorithms are generally, well-suited to such problems, but can be slow and require too much storage if the lattice is too large, for example, if the lattice dimension is too high. Faster algorithms requiring less computer storage can often be constructed by restricting calculations to a “computational volume” known to contain the optimal path.

  abstract     = {DNA barcodes are useful for species discovery and species identification, but obtaining barcodes currently requires a well-equipped molecular laboratory and is time-consuming, and/or expensive. We here address these issues by developing a barcoding pipeline for Oxford Nanopore MinION™ and demonstrating that one flow cell can generate barcodes for 500 specimens despite the high basecall error rates of MinION™ reads. The pipeline overcomes these errors by first summarizing all reads for the same tagged amplicon as a consensus barcode. Consensus barcodes are overall mismatch-free but retain indel errors that are concentrated in homopolymeric regions. They are addressed with an optional error correction pipeline that is based on conserved amino acid motifs from publicly available barcodes. The effectiveness of this pipeline is documented by analysing reads from three MinION™ runs that represent three different stages of MinION™ development. They generated data for (i) 511 specimens of a mixed Diptera sample, (ii) 575 specimens of ants and (iii) 50 specimens of Chironomidae. The run based on the latest chemistry yielded MinION™ barcodes for 490 of the 511 specimens which were assessed against reference Sanger barcodes (N = 471). Overall, the MinION™ barcodes have an accuracy of 99.3\%–100\% with the number of ambiguous bases after correction ranging from {$<$}0.01\% to 1.5\% depending on which correction pipeline is used. We demonstrate that it requires 2 hr of sequencing to gather all information needed for obtaining reliable barcodes for most specimens ({$>$}90\%).

  abstract     = {The Bioperl project is an international open-source collaboration of biologists, bioinformaticians, and computer scientists that has evolved over the past 7 yr into the most comprehensive library of Perl modules available for managing and manipulating life-science information. Bioperl provides an easy-to-use, stable, and consistent programming interface for bioinformatics application programmers. The Bioperl modules have been successfully and repeatedly used to reduce otherwise complex tasks to only a few lines of code. The Bioperl object model has been proven to be flexible enough to support enterprise-level applications such as EnsEMBL, while maintaining an easy learning curve for novice Perl programmers. Bioperl is capable of executing analyses and processing results from programs such as BLAST, ClustalW, or the EMBOSS suite. Interoperation with modules written in Python and Java is supported through the evolving BioCORBA bridge. Bioperl provides access to data stores such as GenBank and SwissProt via a flexible series of sequence input/output modules, and to the emerging common sequence data storage format of the Open Bioinformatics Database Access project. This study describes the overall architecture of the toolkit, the problem domains that it addresses, and gives specific examples of how the toolkit can be used to solve common life-sciences problems. We conclude with a discussion of how the open-source nature of the project has contributed to the development effort. [Supplemental material is available online at www.genome.org.

However, its adoption for drug design has been hindered by the discrete, high-dimensional nature of the decision variables. We develop a new approach (LaMBO) which jointly trains a denoising autoencoder with a discriminative multi-task Gaussian process head, allowing gradient-based optimization of multi-objective acquisition functions in the latent space of the autoencoder. These acquisition functions allow LaMBO to balance the explore-exploit tradeoff over multiple design rounds, and to balance objective tradeoffs by optimizing sequences at many different points on the Pareto frontier. We evaluate LaMBO on two small-molecule design tasks, and introduce new tasks optimizing \textbackslash emph\{in silico\} and \textbackslash emph\{in vitro\} properties of large-molecule fluorescent proteins. In our experiments LaMBO outperforms genetic optimizers and does not require a large pretraining corpus, demonstrating that BayesOpt is practical and effective for biological sequence design.},

  abstract     = {In 1967, it was reported that experimental inoculation of serum from a surgeon (G.B.) with acute hepatitis into tamarins resulted in hepatitis. In 1995, two new members of the family Flaviviridae, named GBV-A and GBV-B, were identified in tamarins that developed hepatitis following inoculation with the 11th GB passage. Neither virus infects humans, and a number of GBV-A variants were identified in wild New World monkeys that were captured. Subsequently, a related human virus was identified [named GBV-C or hepatitis G virus (HGV)], and recently a more distantly related virus (named GBV-D) was discovered in bats. Only GBV-B, a second species within the genus Hepacivirus (type species hepatitis C virus), has been shown to cause hepatitis; it causes acute hepatitis in experimentally infected tamarins. The other GB viruses have however not been assigned to a genus within the family Flaviviridae. Based on phylogenetic relationships, genome organization and pathogenic features of the GB viruses, we propose to classify GBV-A-like viruses, GBV-C and GBV-D as members of a fourth genus in the family Flaviviridae, named Pegivirus (pe, persistent; g, GB or G). We also propose renaming ‘GB’ viruses within the tentative genus Pegivirus to reflect their host origin.},

  abstract     = {The fast replication rate and lack of repair mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) contribute to its high mutation frequency, with some mutations resulting in the evolution of resistance to antiretroviral therapies (ART). As such, studying HIV drug resistance allows for real-time evaluation of evolutionary mechanisms. Characterizing the biological process of drug resistance is also critically important for sustained effectiveness of ART. Investigating the link between \&ldquo;black box\&rdquo; deep learning methods applied to this problem and evolutionary principles governing drug resistance has been overlooked to date. Here, we utilized publicly available HIV-1 sequence data and drug resistance assay results for 18 ART drugs to evaluate the performance of three architectures (multilayer perceptron, bidirectional recurrent neural network, and convolutional neural network) for drug resistance prediction, jointly with biological analysis. We identified convolutional neural networks as the best performing architecture and displayed a correspondence between the importance of biologically relevant features in the classifier and overall performance. Our results suggest that the high classification performance of deep learning models is indeed dependent on drug resistance mutations (DRMs). These models heavily weighted several features that are not known DRM locations, indicating the utility of model interpretability to address causal relationships in viral genotype-phenotype data.},

Here, we developed a method able to retroactively determine the error rate of most public sequencing datasets. To do this, we utilized the overlaps between reads that are a feature of many sequencing libraries. With this method, we surveyed 1943 different datasets from seven different sequencing instruments produced by Illumina. We show that among public datasets, the more expensive platforms like HiSeq and NovaSeq have a lower error rate and less variation. But we also discovered that there is great variation within each platform, with the accuracy of a sequencing experiment depending greatly on the experimenter. We show the importance of sequence context, especially the phenomenon where preceding bases bias the following bases toward the same identity. We also show the difference in patterns of sequence bias between instruments. Contrary to expectations based on the underlying chemistry, HiSeq X Ten and NovaSeq 6000 share notable exceptions to the preceding-base bias. Our results demonstrate the importance of the specific circumstances of every sequencing experiment, and the importance of evaluating the quality of each one.},

Recent deep-learning approaches to protein prediction have shown that pre-training on unlabeled data can yield useful representations for downstream tasks. However, the optimal pre-training strategy remains an open question. Instead of strictly borrowing from natural language processing (NLP) in the form of masked or autoregressive language modeling, we introduce a new pre-training task: directly predicting protein profiles derived from multiple sequence alignments. Using a set of five, standardized downstream tasks for protein models, we demonstrate that our pre-training task along with a multi-task objective outperforms masked language modeling alone on all five tasks. Our results suggest that protein sequence models may benefit from leveraging biologically-inspired inductive biases that go beyond existing language modeling techniques in NLP.},

It refers to a series of algorithmic solutions for the alignment of evolutionarily related sequences while taking into account evolutionary events such as mutations, insertions, deletions, and rearrangements under certain conditions. These methods can be applied to DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. In this work, we take advantage of a center-star strategy to reduce the MSA problem to pairwise alignments, and we use a suffix tree to match identical substrings between two pairwise sequences. Multiple sequence alignment based on a suffix tree and center-star strategy (MASC) can accomplish MSA in O(mn), which is linear time complexity, wheremis the number of sequences andnis the average length of sequences. Furthermore, we execute our method on the Spark-distributed parallel framework to deal with ever-increasing massive data sets. Our method is significantly faster than previous techniques, with no loss in accuracy for highly similar nucleotide sequences like homologous sequences, which we experimentally demonstrate. Comparing with mainstream MSA tools (e.g., MAFFT), MASC could finish the alignment of 67,200 sequences, longer than 10,000\,bps, in 9 minutes, which takes MAFFT {$>$}3.5 days.},

The MSA problem was proven NP-Hard, thus requiring a high amount of memory and computing power. This problem can be modeled as a search for the path with minimum cost in a graph, and the A-Star algorithm has been adapted to solve it sequentially and in parallel. The design of a parallel version for MSA with A-Star is subject to challenges such as irregular dependency pattern and substantial memory requirements. In this paper, we propose PA-Star, a locality-sensitive multithreaded strategy based on A-Star, which computes optimal MSAs using both RAM and disk to store nodes. The experimental results obtained in 3 different machines show that the optimizations used in PA-Star can achieve an acceleration of 1.88× in the serial execution, and the parallel execution can attain an acceleration of 5.52× with 8 cores. We also show that PA-Star outperforms a state-of-the-art MSA tool based on A-Star, executing up to 4.77× faster. Finally, we show that our disk-assisted strategy is able to retrieve the optimal alignment when other tools fail.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The impacts of genetic polymorphisms on drug resistance mutations (DRMs) among various HIV-1 subtypes have long been debated. In this study, we aimed to analyze the natural polymorphisms and acquired DRM profile in HIV-1 CRF01\_AE-infected patients in a large first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) cohort in northeastern China. METHODS: The natural polymorphisms of CRF01\_AE were analyzed in 2034 patients from a long-term ART cohort in northeastern China. The polymorphisms in 105 treatment failure (TF) patients were compared with those in 1148 treatment success (TS) patients. The acquired DRM profile of 42 patients who experienced TF with tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz (TDF/3TC/EFV) treatment was analyzed by comparing the mutations at TF time point to those at baseline. The Stanford HIVdb algorithm was used to interpret the DRMs. Binomial distribution, McNemar test, Wilcoxon test and CorMut package were used to analyze the mutation rates and co-variation. Deep sequencing was used to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of co-variation. RESULTS: Before ART, there were significantly more natural polymorphisms of 31 sites on reverse transcriptase (RT) in CRF01\_AE than subtype B HIV-1 (|Z value|\,≥\,3), including five known drug resistance-associated sites (238, 118, 179, 103, and 40). However, only the polymorphism at site 75 was associated with TF (|Z value|\,≥\,3). The mutation rate at 14 sites increased significantly at TF time point compared to baseline, with the most common DRMs comprising G190S/C, K65R, K101E/N/Q, M184\,V/I, and V179D/I/A/T/E, ranging from 66.7 to 45.2\%. Moreover, two unknown mutations (V75\,L and L228R) increased by 19.0 and 11.9\% respectively, and they were under positive selection (Ka/Ks\,{$>$}\,1, log odds ratio [LOD]\,{$>$}\,2) and were associated with several other DRMs (cKa/Ks\,{$>$}\,1, LOD\,{$>$}\,2). Deep sequencing of longitudinal plasma samples showed that L228R occurred simultaneously or followed the appearance of Y181C. CONCLUSION: The high levels of natural polymorphisms in CRF01\_AE had little impact on treatment outcomes. The findings regarding potential new CRF01\_AE-specific minor DRMs indicate the need for more studies on the drug resistance phenotype of CRF01\_AE.},

In this minireview, we focus on viruses hosted by true fungi and oomycetes (members of Stamenopila, Chromalveolata) inhabiting bulk soil, rhizosphere and litter layer, and representing different ecological guilds, including fungal saprotrophs, mycorrhizal fungi, mutualistic endophytes and pathogens. Viruses infecting fungi and oomycetes are characterized by persistent intracellular nonlytic lifestyles and transmission via spores and/or hyphal contacts. Almost all fungal and oomycete viruses have genomes composed of single-stranded or double-stranded RNA, and recent studies have revealed numerous novel viruses representing yet unclassified family-level groups. Depending on the virus–host combination, infections can be asymptomatic, beneficial or detrimental to the host. Thus, mycovirus infections may contribute to the multiplex interactions of hosts, therefore likely affecting the dynamics of fungal communities required for the functioning of soil ecosystems. However, the effects of fungal and oomycete viruses on soil ecological processes are still mostly unknown. Interestingly, new metagenomics data suggest an extensive level of horizontal virus transfer between plants, fungi and insects.},

  abstract     = {Motivation: UniRef databases provide full-scale clustering of UniProtKB sequences and are utilized for a broad range of applications, particularly similarity-based functional annotation. Non-redundancy and intra-cluster homogeneity in UniRef were recently improved by adding a sequence length overlap threshold. Our hypothesis is that these improvements would enhance the speed and sensitivity of similarity searches and improve the consistency of annotation within clusters.Results: Intra-cluster molecular function consistency was examined by analysis of Gene Ontology terms. Results show that UniRef clusters bring together proteins of identical molecular function in more than 97\% of the clusters, implying that clusters are useful for annotation and can also be used to detect annotation inconsistencies. To examine coverage in similarity results, BLASTP searches against UniRef50 followed by expansion of the hit lists with cluster members demonstrated advantages compared with searches against UniProtKB sequences; the searches are concise (∼7 times shorter hit list before expansion), faster (∼6 times) and more sensitive in detection of remote similarities (\&gt;96\% recall at e-value \&lt;0.0001). Our results support the use of UniRef clusters as a comprehensive and scalable alternative to native sequence databases for similarity searches and reinforces its reliability for use in functional annotation.Availability and implementation: Web access and file download from UniProt website at http://www.uniprot.org/uniref and ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/uniref.

Rule discovery, which is extensively studied in data mining, suffers from the problem of outputting a huge number of rules. An objective interestingness measure can be used to estimate the potential usefulness of a discovered rule based on the given data set thus hopefully serves as a countermeasure to circumvent this problem. Various measures have been proposed, resulting systematic attempts for categorizing such measures. We believe that such attempts are subject to four kinds of pitfalls: data bias, rule bias, expert bias, and search bias. The main objective of this paper is to issue an alert for the pitfalls which are harmful to one of the most important research topics in data mining. We also list desiderata in categorizing objective interestingness measures.},

  abstract     = {We characterized 16 additional mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) whose role in drug resistance is still unknown by analyzing 1,906 plasma-derived HIV-1 subtype B pol sequences from 551 drug-naïve patients and 1,355 nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI)-treated patients. Twelve mutations positively associated with NRTI treatment strongly correlated both in pairs and in clusters with known NRTI resistance mutations on divergent evolutionary pathways. In particular, T39A, K43E/Q, K122E, E203K, and H208Y clustered with the nucleoside analogue mutation 1 cluster (NAM1; M41L+L210W+T215Y). Their copresence in this cluster was associated with an increase in thymidine analogue resistance. Moreover, treatment failure in the presence of K43E, K122E, or H208Y was significantly associated with higher viremia and lower CD4 cell count. Differently, D218E clustered with the NAM2 pathway (D67N+K70R+K219Q+T215F), and its presence in this cluster determined an increase in zidovudine resistance. In contrast, three mutations (V35I, I50V, and R83K) negatively associated with NRTI treatment showed negative correlations with NRTI resistance mutations and were associated with increased susceptibility to specific NRTIs. In particular, I50V negatively correlated with the lamivudine-selected mutation M184V and was associated with a decrease in M184V/lamivudine resistance, whereas R83K negatively correlated with both NAM1 and NAM2 clusters and was associated with a decrease in thymidine analogue resistance. Finally, the association pattern of the F214L polymorphism revealed its propensity for the NAM2 pathway and its strong negative association with the NAM1 pathway. Our study provides evidence of novel RT mutational patterns that regulate positively and/or negatively NRTI resistance and strongly suggests that other mutations beyond those currently known to confer resistance should be considered for improved prediction of clinical response to antiretroviral drugs.},

  abstract     = {Plasma-derived sequences of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease from 1,162 patients (457 drug-naïve patients and 705 patients receiving protease inhibitor [PI]-containing antiretroviral regimens) led to the identification and characterization of 17 novel protease mutations potentially associated with resistance to PIs. Fourteen mutations were positively associated with PIs and significantly correlated in pairs and/or clusters with known PI resistance mutations, suggesting their contribution to PI resistance. In particular, E34Q, K43T, and K55R, which were associated with lopinavir treatment, correlated with mutations associated with lopinavir resistance (E34Q with either L33F or F53L, or K43T with I54A) or clustered with multi-PI resistance mutations (K43T with V82A and I54V or V82A, V32I, and I47V, or K55R with V82A, I54V, and M46I). On the other hand, C95F, which was associated with treatment with saquinavir and indinavir, was highly expressed in clusters with either L90M and I93L or V82A and G48V. K45R and K20T, which were associated with nelfinavir treatment, were specifically associated with D30N and N88D and with L90M, respectively. Structural analysis showed that several correlated positions were within 8 Å of each other, confirming the role of the local environment for interactions among mutations. We also identified three protease mutations (T12A, L63Q, and H69N) whose frequencies significantly decreased in PI-treated patients compared with that in drug-naïve patients. They never showed positive correlations with PI resistance mutations; if anything, H69N showed a negative correlation with the compensatory mutations M36I and L10I. These mutations may prevent the appearance of PI resistance mutations, thus increasing the genetic barrier to PI resistance. Overall, our study contributes to a better definition of protease mutational patterns that regulate PI resistance and strongly suggests that other (novel) mutations beyond those currently known to confer resistance should be taken into account to better predict resistance to antiretroviral drugs.},

  abstract     = {Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are probabilistic models widely used in applications in computational sequence analysis. HMMs are basically unsupervised models. However, in the most important applications, they are trained in a supervised manner. Training examples accompanied by labels corresponding to different classes are given as input and the set of parameters that maximize the joint probability of sequences and labels is estimated. A main problem with this approach is that, in the majority of the cases, labels are hard to find and thus the amount of training data is limited. On the other hand, there are plenty of unclassified (unlabeled) sequences deposited in the public databases that could potentially contribute to the training procedure. This approach is called semi-supervised learning and could be very helpful in many applications.We propose here, a method for semi-supervised learning of HMMs that can incorporate labeled, unlabeled and partially labeled data in a straightforward manner. The algorithm is based on a variant of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, where the missing labels of the unlabeled or partially labeled data are considered as the missing data. We apply the algorithm to several biological problems, namely, for the prediction of transmembrane protein topology for alpha-helical and beta-barrel membrane proteins and for the prediction of archaeal signal peptides. The results are very promising, since the algorithms presented here can significantly improve the prediction performance of even the top-scoring classifiers.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract      = {Ensembles of decision trees have good prediction accuracy but suffer from a lack of interpretability. We propose a new approach for interpreting tree ensembles by finding prototypes in tree space, utilizing the naturally-learned similarity measure from the tree ensemble. Demonstrating the method on random forests, we show that the method benefits from unique aspects of tree ensembles by leveraging tree structure to sequentially find prototypes. The method provides good prediction accuracy when found prototypes are used in nearest-prototype classifiers, while using fewer prototypes than competitor methods. We are investigating the sensitivity of the method to different prototype-finding procedures and demonstrating it on higher-dimensional data.},

  abstract     = {Objective:~         Determine the pattern of drug resistance among HIV infected drug exposed patients failing therapy in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.         Methods:~         The protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) of 87 samples from 75 treatment exposed HIV infected patients failing therapy were PCR amplified, sequenced, subtyped and analyzed for the presence of drug resistance mutations.         Results:~         The most common drugs used were 3TC, AZT (or d4T) and EFV. The dominant subtypes were CRF06\_cpx (48\%) and CRF02\_AG (40\%). The prevalence of resistance mutations among patients failing therapy was: PR inhibitors (PI), 40\%; non-nucleoside RT-inhibitors (NNRTI), 76\% and nucleoside RT-inhibitors (NRTI), 85\%. Dominant mutations included M46I (37\%), 154V (26\%), V82A/T/F (30\%) in PR; K103N (44\%), G190A/S (16\%) and T215F/Y (48\%) (NRTIs) in RT. Some resistance mutations, notably D67N/G, K70R and L210W (thymidine analogue mutations-TAMs); K101E, V179E in RT, 154V, V82A/T/F and L90M in PR were significantly higher among CRF06\_cpx than CRF02\_AG strains (P {$<$} 0.05). Although not significant, other TAMs (M41L, T215F/Y, K219Q/E) also occurred more frequently among CRF06\_cpx strains as well.         Conclusion:~         There is a high prevalence of drug resistance mutations among ARV exposed patients in Burkina Faso with an unexpected subtype-specific difference. Validation of this result will require larger sample sizes and in vitro drug susceptibility studies with CRF06\_cpx strains.},

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure, and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

Pull-down menus provide all the options required for traditional multiple sequence and profile alignment. New features include: the ability to cut-and-paste sequences to change the order of the alignment, selection of a subset of the sequences to be realigned, and selection of a sub-range of the alignment to be realigned and inserted back into the original alignment. Alignment quality analysis can be performed and low-scoring segments or exceptional residues can be highlighted. Quality analysis and realignment of selected residue ranges provide the user with a powerful tool to improve and refine difficult alignments and to trap errors in input sequences.

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

This changed again with the advent of third generation long read sequencers. The length of the long reads allows a much better resolution of repetitive regions, their high error rate however is a major challenge. Using the data successfully requires to remove most of the sequencing errors. The first hybrid correction methods used low noise second generation data to correct third generation data, but this approach has issues when it is unclear where to place the short reads due to repeats and also because second generation sequencers fail to sequence some regions which third generation sequencers work on. Later non hybrid methods appeared. We present a new method for non hybrid long read error correction based on De Bruijn graph assembly of short windows of long reads with subsequent combination of these correct windows to corrected long reads. Our experiments show that this method yields a better correction than other state of the art non hybrid correction approaches.},

  abstract  = {Despite an explosion in the number of experimentally determined, atomically detailed structures of biomolecules, many critical tasks in structural biology remain data-limited.  Whether performance in such tasks can be improved by using large repositories of tangentially related structural data remains an open question.  To address this question, we focused on a central problem in biology: predicting how proteins interact with one another—that is, which surfaces of one protein bind to those of another protein.  We built a training dataset, the Database of Interacting Protein Structures (DIPS), that contains biases but is two orders of magnitude larger than those used previously.  We found that these biases significantly degrade the performance of existing methods on gold-standard data.  Hypothesizing that assumptions baked into the hand-crafted features on which these methods depend were the source of the problem, we developed the first end-to-end learning model for protein interface prediction, the Siamese Atomic Surfacelet Network (SASNet).  Using only spatial coordinates and identities of atoms, SASNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods trained on gold-standard structural data, even when trained on only 3\% of our new dataset.

  abstract     = {An amino acid substitution scoring matrix encapsulates the rates at which various amino acid residues in proteins are substituted by other amino acid residues, over time. Database search methods make use of substitution scoring matrices to identify sequences with homologous relationships. However, widely used substitution scoring matrices, such as BLOSUM series, have been developed using aligned blocks that are mostly devoid of disordered regions in proteins. Hence, these substitution-scoring matrices are mostly inappropriate for homology searches involving proteins enriched with disordered regions as the disordered regions have distinct amino acid compositional bias, and therefore expected to have undergone amino acid substitutions that are distinct from those in the ordered regions. We, therefore, developed a novel series of substitution scoring matrices referred to as EDSSMat by exclusively considering the substitution frequencies of amino acids in the disordered regions of the eukaryotic proteins. The newly developed matrices were tested for their ability to detect homologs of proteins enriched with disordered regions by means of SSEARCH tool. The results unequivocally demonstrate that EDSSMat matrices detect more number of homologs than the widely used BLOSUM, PAM and other standard matrices, indicating their utility value for homology searches of intrinsically disordered proteins.},

@article{tsengEstimationAminoAcid2006,
  abstract     = {Amino acid sequences are an important source of information for inferring distant phylogenetic relationships and for predicting the biochemical functions of protein. Because the substitutions of nucleotides can become rapidly saturated, and the likelihood of unrelated identical substitutions is high for nucleotides, the information of evolutionary conservation of nucleotides is quickly obscured after a number of generations. The mapping of DNA sequences by the genetic code to amino acid sequences frequently can reveal more remote evolutionary relation with more interpretable sequence similarity (Lio` and Goldman 1999). In addition, statistical analysis of protein sequence alignment is also more reliable as it is much more difficult to detect and correct for deviations from independent identical distributions in DNA sequences due to possible translation of normal complexity DNA sequences into low complexity protein sequences such as tandem repeats of simple patterns of a few residues (Pearson 1998). The success in detecting evolutionarily related protein sequences through sequence alignment depends on the use of a scoring matrix, which determines the similarity between residues. Rate matrices of amino acid residue substitutions can be the basis for developing many scoring matrices for sequence alignment. Dayhoff, Schwartz, and Orcutt (1978) were the first to develop empirical models of amino acid residue substitutions. They used a counting method to obtain accepted point mutation matrices (called Pam matrices). The widely used Blosum matrices can be viewed as analogous to transition matrices of residues at different time intervals (S. Henikoff and J. G. Henikoff 1992; Lio` and Goldman 1998). They were developed following a heuristic counting approach similar to that of Pam and were derived from structure-based alignments of blocks of sequences of related proteins (S. Henikoff and J. G.},

After decades of effort, 17\% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure1. Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold2, at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool~that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},

  abstract     = {Objective Drug resistance-associated mutations (DRMs) among HIV-1 treatment-naïve patients have increased in recent years. Their incidence and prevalence in various exposure risk categories (ERCs) were evaluated. Design Plasma samples of HIV-1 treatment-naïve patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2009 at the Tel Aviv Medical Center were screened for DRMs. Methods Samples obtained from patients following the HIV diagnosis were analysed retrospectively. Genotyping was carried out using the Trugene HIV-1 genotype kit (Siemens, Berkeley, CA, USA). Phylogenetic relationships among viral sequences were estimated using the maximum likelihood method. Results Thirty-eight of the 266 analysed sequences (14.3\%) had DRMs, all occurring exclusively in the group of men who have sex with men (MSM). The rate of DRMs has constantly risen, reaching a peak of 21.9\% in 2009. Notably, protease inhibitor (PI) DRMs became the most frequent DRMs in 2009. Phylogenetic analysis showed a tight cluster comprising 13 of 14 viruses harbouring the L90M major PI resistance mutation, suggesting a single infection source. Conclusion There was an unexpectedly high rate of the major L90M PI resistance mutation in the MSM group. The clustered transmission of this mutation might be related to a high-risk sexual behaviour. Added to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance mutations, such a PI mutation may limit future therapeutic options for this particular patient population.},

Yet external benchmarking of this technologies’ capabilities has not been extensively reported, nor has thorough evaluation of its utility for field-based analysis with sub-optimal sample types been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of the MinION sequencer for bacterial genomic and metagenomic applications, with specific emphasis placed on the quality, yield, and accuracy of generated sequence data. Two independent laboratories at the National Microbiology Laboratory (Public Health Agency of Canada), sequenced a set of microbes in replicate, using the currently available flowcells, sequencing chemistries, and software available at the time of the experiment. Overall sequencing yield and quality improved through the course of this set of experiments. Sequencing alignment accuracy was high reaching 97\% for all 2D experiments, though was slightly lower for 1D sequencing (94\%). 1D sequencing provided much longer sequences than 2D. Both sequencing chemistries performed equally well in constructing genomic assemblies. There was evidence of barcode cross-over using both the native and PCR barcoding methods. Despite the sub-optimal nature of samples sequenced in the field, sequences attributable to B. anthracis the target organism used in this scenario, could none-the-less be detected. Together, this report showcases the rapid advancement in this technology and its utility in the context of genomic sequencing of microbial isolates of importance to public health.},

Mutation prevalences were determined using integrase sequences from 17302 INSTI-naive and 2450 INSTI-treated persons; 53.3\% of the INSTI-naive sequences and 20.0\% of INSTI-treated sequences were from non-B subtypes. Approximately 10\% of sequences were from persons who received dolutegravir alone or a first-generation INSTI followed by dolutegravir.Fifty-nine previously recognized (or established) INSTI-resistance mutations were present on one or more of four published expert lists. They were classified into three main non-overlapping groups: 29 relatively common non-polymorphic mutations, occurring in five or more individuals and significantly selected by INSTI treatment; 8 polymorphic mutations; and 22 rare mutations. Among the 29 relatively common INSTI-selected mutations, 24 emerged as candidates for inclusion on a list of INSTI surveillance drug-resistance mutations: T66A/I/K, E92G/Q, G118R, F121Y, E138A/K/T, G140A/C/S, Y143C/H/R/S, S147G, Q148H/R/K, N155H, S230R and R263K.A set of 24 non-polymorphic INSTI-selected mutations is likely to be useful for quantifying INSTI-associated TDR.

The aim of the study is to collate routinely collected data on HIV-infected individuals attending one of seven clinical centres in the UK since 1 January 1996, with the objectives of describing changes over time in the frequency of AIDS-defining illnesses, describing the uptake of and response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and identifying factors associated with virological and immunological responses to HAART. Methods By December 2002, demographic, clinical and laboratory data had been collected on HIV-positive patients seen at six of the seven HIV centres. Missing and inconsistent data had been investigated and the datasets audited. Records identified as relating to the same patient had been merged, and cross-checks made with UK death registers to improve the accuracy of death reporting. Results The cohort currently contains information on 13 833 individuals. Eighty-two per cent of the cohort are male, and the median age was 34 years at first follow-up. The main risk factors for HIV infection have been determined as sex between men (63\%) and sex between men and women (24\%). Twenty-five per cent of the cohort are known to have developed AIDS, and 8\% have died. Conclusions The UK CHIC Study provides important information on the status of individuals infected with HIV in the UK, and provides a means to study the response to HAART and to monitor changes in the clinical event and death rates that have occurred since the introduction of HAART in the UK.},

This problem arises in data processing applications such as comparing two files and in genetic applications such as studying molecular evolution. The difficulty of computing a longest common subsequence of two strings is examined using the decision tree model of computation, in which vertices represent “equal - unequal” comparisons. It is shown that unless a bound on the total number of distinct symbols is assumed, every solution to the problem can consume an amount of time that is proportional to the product of the lengths of the two strings. A general lower bound as a function of the ratio of alphabet size to string length is derived. The case where comparisons between symbols of the same string are forbidden is also considered and it is shown that this problem is of linear complexity for a two-symbol alphabet and quadratic for an alphabet of three or more symbols.},

This generalization introduces new connections between measures. They lead to the enhancement of some measures. We then propose new parameterized possibilities.

  abstract     = {Objectives Clinical relevance of low-frequency HIV-1 variants carrying drug resistance associated mutations (DRMs) is still unclear. We aimed to study the prevalence of low-frequency DRMs, detected by Ultra-Deep Sequencing (UDS) before antiretroviral therapy (ART) and at virological failure (VF), in HIV-1 infected patients experiencing VF on first-line ART. Methods Twenty-nine ART-naive patients followed up in the ANRS-CO3 Aquitaine Cohort, having initiated ART between 2000 and 2009 and experiencing VF (2 plasma viral loads (VL) {$>$}500 copies/ml or one VL {$>$}1000 copies/ml) were included. Reverse transcriptase and protease DRMs were identified using Sanger sequencing (SS) and UDS at baseline (before ART initiation) and VF. Results Additional low-frequency variants with PI-, NNRTI- and NRTI-DRMs were found by UDS at baseline and VF, significantly increasing the number of detected DRMs by 1.35 fold (p{$<$}0.0001) compared to SS. These low-frequency DRMs modified ARV susceptibility predictions to the prescribed treatment for 1 patient at baseline, in whom low-frequency DRM was found at high frequency at VF, and 6 patients at VF. DRMs found at VF were rarely detected as low-frequency DRMs prior to treatment. The rare low-frequency NNRTI- and NRTI-DRMs detected at baseline that correlated with the prescribed treatment were most often found at high-frequency at VF. Conclusion Low frequency DRMs detected before ART initiation and at VF in patients experiencing VF on first-line ART can increase the overall burden of resistance to PI, NRTI and NNRTI.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The HIV-1 epidemic in West Africa is characterized by a slower rise than that in Eastern and Southern Africa. The HIV-2 epidemic in West Africa may be declining, but few long-term data exist. METHODS: In a research clinic in The Gambia, HIV-1 and HIV-2 prevalence trends among all new patients being tested for HIV were examined over a 16 year period (1988 till 2003). In newly diagnosed patients a baseline CD4 count was done. RESULTS: An HIV test was done in 23 363 patients aged 15 years or older. The prevalence of HIV-1 was 4.2\% in 1988-91 and rose to 17.5\% in 2001-03 (P {$<$} 0.0001, chi(2)-test for trend). The prevalence of HIV-2 was 7.0\% in 1988-91 and declined to 4.0\% in 2001-03 (P {$<$} 0.0001). HIV-1 prevalence increased and HIV-2 prevalence decreased with time in logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, and indication for test (P {$<$} 0.0001). Baseline CD4 counts were available for 65\% of patients. The median CD4 count was 215 cells/mm3 [interquartile range (IQR) 72-424] for HIV-1, and 274 (IQR 100-549) for HIV-2 infected patients. There was no marked trend of rise or decline in baseline CD4 count in either HIV-1 or HIV-2 infected patients over the study period. Forty-five per cent of newly diagnosed HIV patients had a CD4 count {$<$}200 cells/mm3. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that HIV-1 prevalence is rising in The Gambia, and that HIV-2 is declining. HIV patients in The Gambia present late and almost half of patients would qualify for anti-retroviral treatment at their first visit.},

A second revolution came when next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies appeared, which made genome sequencing much cheaper and faster. However, NGS methods have several drawbacks and pitfalls, most notably their short reads. Recently, third-generation/long-read methods appeared, which can produce genome assemblies of unprecedented quality. Moreover, these technologies can directly detect epigenetic modifications on native DNA and allow whole-transcript sequencing without the need for assembly. This marks the third revolution in sequencing technology. Here we review and compare the various long-read methods. We discuss their applications and their respective strengths and weaknesses and provide future perspectives.},

Although traditionally recognized for their ability to invade and infect host cells, viruses and bacteriophages have been engineered over the past decade as highly promising molecular platforms for the targeted delivery and treatment of many human diseases. Inherently biodegradable, the outer capsids of viruses are composed entirely of protein building blocks, which can be genetically or chemically engineered with molecular imaging reagents, targeting ligands and therapeutic molecules. While there are several examples of viruses as in vitro molecular cargo carriers, their potential for applications in nanomedicine has only recently emerged.

We compare the results of a commercial STR profiling kit (Applied Biosystems AmpFlSTR® Profiler Plus®), analyzed both with capillary electrophoresis and with Roche GS FLX sequencing. An easy to use open-source software pipeline is provided, chaining together the different steps needed to start the analysis from a GS FLX FASTA file, resulting in a FASTA file containing the called and quantified alleles present in the data. Sequencing of multiplexed STR amplicons using Roche GS FLX titanium technology is technically feasible but the technology is not ideal for this purpose. The fraction of full length reads is small and the homopolymer sequencing error rate is high. The pipeline compresses the homopolymers to a single base to avoid false results caused by these homopolymers. The qualitative and quantitative results from the SGS STR analysis pipeline are comparable to the electrophoresis method. Additionally, the SGS method provides extra information and is able to call allele subtypes based on STR sequences in a database. In mixed samples, all alleles were reported from individuals that contributed at least 10\% to the mixture.},

A salient characteristic of the Interpolator-Based Kronecker Product Graph Matching (IBKPGM) algorithm is that it does not require the explicit calculation of compatibility values between vertices and edges, either using compatibility functions or probability distributions. No assumption is made about the adjacency structure of the graphs to be matched. The IBKPGM algorithm uses Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) interpolator theory to obtain an unconstrained estimate to the Kronecker Match Matrix (KMM) from which a permutation sub-matrix is inferred.},

Twen- ?ve years is a long period of time. During these years many things have happened. Looking back, one can see how rapidly life and technology have changed, and how slow and dif?cult it is to change the theoretical foundation of the technology and its philosophy. I pursued two goals writing this Afterword: to update the technical results presented in EDBED (the easy goal) and to describe a general picture of how the new ideas developed over these years (a much more dif?cult goal). The picture which I would like to present is a very personal (and therefore very biased) account of the development of one particular branch of science, Empirical - ference Science. Such accounts usually are not included in the content of technical publications. I have followed this rule in all of my previous books. But this time I would like to violate it for the following reasons. First of all, for me EDBED is the important milestone in the development of empirical inference theory and I would like to explain why. S- ond, during these years, there were a lot of discussions between supporters of the new 1 paradigm (now it is called the VC theory ) and the old one (classical statistics).},

  abstract     = {In order to evaluate the usefulness of resistance testing after a viral rebound with plasma HIV RNA levels of less than 1,000 copies (c)/ml, genotyping was performed on 39 samples from patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) showing a viremia of over 50 c/ml up to a maximum of 1,000 c/ml after at least one undetectable viral load result. Protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences were obtained for all 39 samples. In 10 (25.6\%) of the samples, mutations not seen before the initiation of the regimen were observed. The M184V/I mutation was the most prevalent but in several patients a combination of multiple mutations was detected. Follow-up samples were available for 34 patients. In six (85.71\%) out of seven patients with new mutations, the viral load on the follow-up visit remained detectable, indicating true failure, compared to 6 (31.6\%) true failures out of 19 patients in whom only wild type virus was detected (P = 0.02) and three (37.5\%) out of eight patients in whom only the mutations already present at the initiation of HAART were seen (P = 0.08). The results indicate that reliable resistance testing can be performed on samples with a viral burden of less than 1,000 c/ml and demonstrate that multiple drug resistance mutations can be selected at low viral load rebounds. Most importantly, detection of resistance mutations in viral rebound samples was predictive of subsequent virological failure. J. Med.

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study was to document the genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC; formerly Zaire). A total of 247 HIV-1-positive samples, collected during an epidemiologic survey conducted in 1997 in three regions (Kinshasa [the capital], Bwamanda [in the north], and Mbuyi-Maya [in the south]), were genetically characterized in the env V3-V5 region. All known subtypes were found to cocirculate, and for 6\% of the samples the subtype could not be identified. Subtype A is predominant, with prevalences decreasing from north to south (69\% in the north, 53\% in the capital city, and 46\% in the south). Subtype C, D, G, and H prevalences range from 7 to 9\%, whereas subtype F, J, K, and CRF01-AE strains represent 2 to 4\% of the samples; only one subtype B strain was identified. The highest prevalence (25\%) of subtype C was in the south, and CRF01-AE was seen mainly in the north. The high intersubtype variability among the V3-V5 sequences is the most probable reason for the low (45\%) efficiency of subtype A-specific PCR and HMA (heteroduplex mobility assay). Eighteen (29\%) of 62 samples had discordant subtype designations between env and gag. Sequence analysis of the entire envelope from 13 samples confirmed the high degree of diversity and complexity of HIV-1 strains in the DRC; 9 had a complex recombinant structure in gp160, involving fragments of known and unknown subtypes. Interestingly, the unknown fragments from the different strains did not cluster together. Overall, the high number of HIV-1 subtypes cocirculating, the high intrasubtype diversity, and the high numbers of possible recombinant viruses as well as different unclassified strains are all in agreement with an old and mature epidemic in the DRC, suggesting that this region is the epicenter of HIV-1 group M.},

  abstract     = {The hall mark of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a gradual loss of CD4+ T-cells and imbalance in CD4+ T-cell homeostasis, with progressive impairment of immunity that leads ultimately to death. HIV infection in humans is caused by two related yet distinct viruses: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-2 is typically less virulent than HIV-1 and permits the host to mount a more effective and sustained T-cell immunity. Although both infections manifest the same clinical spectrum, the much lower rate of CD4+ T-cell decline and slower progression of disease in HIV-2 infected individuals have grabbed the attention of several researchers. Here, we review the most recent findings on the differential rate of decline of CD4+ T-cell in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections and provide plausible reasons for the observed differences between the two groups.},

  abstract      = {Transformer architectures have proven to learn useful representations for protein classification and generation tasks. However, these representations present challenges in interpretability. In this work, we demonstrate a set of methods for analyzing protein Transformer models through the lens of attention. We show that attention: (1) captures the folding structure of proteins, connecting amino acids that are far apart in the underlying sequence, but spatially close in the three-dimensional structure, (2) targets binding sites, a key functional component of proteins, and (3) focuses on progressively more complex biophysical properties with increasing layer depth. We find this behavior to be consistent across three Transformer architectures (BERT, ALBERT, XLNet) and two distinct protein datasets. We also present a three-dimensional visualization of the interaction between attention and protein structure.

  abstract     = {Objective:~In resource-limited countries, antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been scaled up, but individual monitoring is still suboptimal. Here, we studied whether or not ART had an impact on the frequency and selection of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) under these settings. We also examined whether differences exist between HIV-1 genetic variants.         Design:~A total of 3736 sequences from individuals failing standard first-line ART (n = 1599, zidovudine/stavudine + lamivudine + neviparine/efavirenz) were analyzed and compared with sequences from reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI)-naive individuals (n = 2137) from 10 West and Central African countries.         Methods:~Fisher exact tests and corrections for multiple comparisons were used to assess the significance of associations.         Results:~All RTI-DRM from the 2015 International Antiviral Society list, except F227C, and nine mutations from other expert lists were observed to confer extensive resistance and cross-resistance. Five additional independently selected mutations (I94L, L109I, V111L, T139R and T165L) were statistically associated with treatment. The proportion of sequences with multiple mutations and the frequency of all thymidine analog mutations, M184V, certain NNRTIS, I94L and L109I showed substantial increase with time on ART. Only one nucleoside and two nonnucleoside RTI-DRMs differed by subtype/circulating recombinant form.         Conclusion:~This study validates the global robustness of the actual DRM repertoire, in particular for circulating recombinant form 02 predominating in West and Central Africa, despite our finding of five additional selected mutations. However, long-term ART without virological monitoring clearly leads to the accumulation of mutations and the emergence of additional variations, which limit drug options for treatment and can be transmitted. Improved monitoring and optimization of ART are necessary for the long-term effectiveness of ART.},

Nevertheless, a number of questions concerning their properties and inter-relationships remain unresolved. In this paper, we perform an organized study of information theoretic measures for clustering comparison, including several existing popular measures in the literature, as well as some newly proposed ones. We discuss and prove their important properties, such as the metric property and the normalization property. We then highlight to the clustering community the importance of correcting information theoretic measures for chance, especially when the data size is small compared to the number of clusters present therein. Of the available information theoretic based measures, we advocate the normalized information distance (NID) as a general measure of choice, for it possesses concurrently several important properties, such as being both a metric and a normalized measure, admitting an exact analytical adjusted-for-chance form, and using the nominal [0, 1] range better than other normalized variants.},

  abstract   = {Estimating the true number of clusters in a data set is one of the major challenges in cluster analysis. Yet in certain domains,knowing the true number of clusters is of high importance. For example, in medical research, detecting the true number of groups and sub-groups of cancer would be of utmost importance for their effective treatment. In this paper we propose a novel method to estimate the number of clusters in a micro array data set based on the consensus clustering approach. Although the main objective of consensus clustering is to discover a robust and high quality cluster structure in a data set, closer inspection of the set of clusterings obtained can often give valuable information about the appropriate number of clusters present. More specifically, the set off clusterings obtained when the specified number of clusters coincides with the true number of clusters tends to be less diverse.To quantify this diversity we develop a novel index, namely the Consensus Index (CI), which is built upon a suitable clustering similarity measure such as the well known Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)or our recently developed, information theoretic based index, namely the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI). Our experiments on both synthetic and real microarray data sets indicate that the CI is a useful indicator for determining the appropriate number of clusters.},

The development of effective intervention strategies relies on the knowledge of molecular and cellular mechanisms of coronavirus infections, which highlights the significance of studying virus–host interactions at the molecular level to identify targets for antiviral intervention and to elucidate critical viral and host determinants that are decisive for the development of severe disease.

  abstract     = {Identifying the source of transmission using pathogen genetic data is complicated by numerous biological, immunological, and behavioral factors. A large source of error arises when there is incomplete or sparse sampling of cases. Unsampled cases may act as either a common source of infection or as an intermediary in a transmission chain for hosts infected with genetically similar pathogens. It is difficult to quantify the probability of common source or intermediate transmission events, which has made it difficult to develop statistical tests to either confirm or deny putative transmission pairs with genetic data. We present a method to incorporate additional information about an infectious disease epidemic, such as incidence and prevalence of infection over time, to inform estimates of the probability that one sampled host is the direct source of infection of another host in a pathogen gene genealogy. These methods enable forensic applications, such as source-case attribution, for infectious disease epidemics with incomplete sampling, which is usually the case for high-morbidity community-acquired pathogens like HIV, Influenza and Dengue virus. These methods also enable epidemiological applications such as the identification of factors that increase the risk of transmission. We demonstrate these methods in the context of the HIV epidemic in Detroit, Michigan, and we evaluate the suitability of current sequence databases for forensic and epidemiological investigations. We find that currently available sequences collected for drug resistance testing of HIV are unlikely to be useful in most forensic investigations, but are useful for identifying transmission risk factors.},

We performed successive infections of the same host cell population followed by automated high-throughput microscopy and observed that infected cells have a higher probability of being reinfected. Establishing a predictive model, we identified two combined origins of host cell vulnerability: pathogen-induced cellular vulnerability emerging from Salmonella uptake and persisting at later stages of the infection and host cell-inherent vulnerability. We linked the host cell-inherent vulnerability with its morphological attributes, such as local cell crowding, and with host cell cholesterol content. This showed that the probability of Salmonella infection success can be forecast from morphological or molecular host cell parameters.},

  abstract     = {The combination of incessant advances in sequencing technology producing large amounts of data and innovative bioinformatics approaches, designed to cope with this data flood, has led to new interesting results in the life sciences. Given the magnitude of sequence data to be processed, many bioinformatics tools rely on efficient solutions to a variety of complex string problems. These solutions include fast heuristic algorithms and advanced data structures, generally referred to as index structures. Although the importance of index structures is generally known to the bioinformatics community, the design and potency of these data structures, as well as their properties and limitations, are less understood. Moreover, the last decade has seen a boom in the number of variant index structures featuring complex and diverse memory-time trade-offs. This article brings a comprehensive state-of-the-art overview of the most popular index structures and their recently developed variants. Their features, interrelationships, the trade-offs they impose, but also their practical limitations, are explained and compared.},

  abstract     = {Advances in modern sequencing technologies allow us to generate sufficient data to analyze hundreds of bacterial genomes from a single machine in a single day. This potential for sequencing massive numbers of genomes calls for fully automated methods to produce high-quality assemblies and variant calls. We introduce Pilon, a fully automated, all-in-one tool for correcting draft assemblies and calling sequence variants of multiple sizes, including very large insertions and deletions. Pilon works with many types of sequence data, but is particularly strong when supplied with paired end data from two Illumina libraries with small e.g., 180 bp and large e.g., 3–5 Kb inserts. Pilon significantly improves draft genome assemblies by correcting bases, fixing mis-assemblies and filling gaps. For both haploid and diploid genomes, Pilon produces more contiguous genomes with fewer errors, enabling identification of more biologically relevant genes. Furthermore, Pilon identifies small variants with high accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art tools and is unique in its ability to accurately identify large sequence variants including duplications and resolve large insertions. Pilon is being used to improve the assemblies of thousands of new genomes and to identify variants from thousands of clinically relevant bacterial strains. Pilon is freely available as open source software.},

@article{wangAccurateNovoPrediction2017,
  abstract     = {Motivation Protein contacts contain key information for the understanding of protein structure and function and thus, contact prediction from sequence is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not very useful for de novo structure prediction. Method This paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual neural networks. The first residual network conducts a series of 1-dimensional convolutional transformation of sequential features; the second residual network conducts a series of 2-dimensional convolutional transformation of pairwise information including output of the first residual network, EC information and pairwise potential. By using very deep residual networks, we can accurately model contact occurrence patterns and complex sequence-structure relationship and thus, obtain higher-quality contact prediction regardless of how many sequence homologs are available for proteins in question. Results Our method greatly outperforms existing methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted folding. Tested on 105 CASP11 targets, 76 past CAMEO hard targets, and 398 membrane proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained by our method, one representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints but without any force fields can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore{$>$}0.6) for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models especially for membrane proteins. The 3D models built from our contact prediction have TMscore{$>$}0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins, while those from homology modeling have TMscore{$>$}0.5 for only 10 of them. Further, even if trained mostly by soluble proteins, our deep learning method works very well on membrane proteins. In the recent blind CAMEO benchmark, our fully-automated web server implementing this method successfully folded 6 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs, including one β protein of 182 residues, one α+β protein of 125 residues, one α protein of 140 residues, one α protein of 217 residues, one α/β of 260 residues and one α protein of 462 residues. Our method also achieved the highest F1 score on free-modeling targets in the latest CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction), although it was not fully implemented back then.

We performed ultra-deep pyrosequencing to detect minor sequence variants in HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes from clinical plasma samples. We estimated empirical error rates from four HIV-1 plasmid clones and used them to develop a statistical approach to distinguish authentic minor variants from sequencing errors in eight clinical samples. Ultra-deep pyrosequencing detected an average of 58 variants per sample compared with an average of eight variants per sample detected by conventional direct-PCR dideoxynucleotide sequencing. In the clinical sample with the largest number of minor sequence variants, all 60 variants present in ≥3\% of genomes and 20 of 35 variants present in {$<$}3\% of genomes were confirmed by limiting dilution sequencing. With appropriate analysis, ultra-deep pyrosequencing is a promising method for characterizing genetic diversity and detecting minor yet clinically relevant variants in biological samples with complex genetic populations.},

@article{wangComparisonLinearGap2011,
  abstract     = {Profile–profile alignment algorithms have proven powerful for recognizing remote homologs and generating alignments by effectively integrating sequence evolutionary information into scoring functions. In comparison to scoring function, the development of gap penalty functions has rarely been addressed in profile–profile alignment algorithms. Although indel frequency profiles have been used to construct profile-based variable gap penalties in some profile–profile alignment algorithms, there is still no fair comparison between variable gap penalties and traditional linear gap penalties to quantify the improvement of alignment accuracy. We compared two linear gap penalty functions, the traditional affine gap penalty (AGP) and the bilinear gap penalty (BGP), with two profile-based variable gap penalty functions, the Profile-based Gap Penalty used in SP5 (SPGP) and a new Weighted Profile-based Gap Penalty (WPGP) developed by us, on some well-established benchmark datasets. Our results show that profile-based variable gap penalties get limited improvements than linear gap penalties, whether incorporated with secondary structure information or not. Secondary structure information appears less powerful to be incorporated into gap penalties than into scoring functions. Analysis of gap length distributions indicates that gap penalties could stably maintain corresponding distributions of gap lengths in their alignments, but the distribution difference from reference alignments does not reflect the performance of gap penalties. There is useful information in indel frequency profiles, but it is still not good enough for improving alignment accuracy when used in profile-based variable gap penalties.

Similar to traditional storage which impose restrictions on the form of encoded data, data stored in DNA storage systems are also subject to two biochemical constraints, i.e., maximum homopolymer run limit and balanced GC content limit. Previous studies used successive process to satisfy these two constraints. As a result, the process suffers low efficiency and high complexity. In this letter, we propose a novel content-balanced run-length limited code with an efficient code construction method, which generates short DNA sequences that satisfy both constraints at one time. Besides, we develop an encoding method to map binary data into long DNA sequences for DNA data storage, which ensures both local and global stability in terms of satisfying the biochemical constraints. The proposed encoding method has high effective code rate of 1.917 bits per nucleotide and low coding complexity.},

However, experimental approaches have only determined the methylation state of a small portion of the human genome. We developed deep learning based (stacked denoising autoencoders, or SdAs) software named “DeepMethyl” to predict the methylation state of DNA CpG dinucleotides using features inferred from three-dimensional genome topology (based on Hi-C) and DNA sequence patterns. We used the experimental data from immortalised myelogenous leukemia (K562) and healthy lymphoblastoid (GM12878) cell lines to train the learning models and assess prediction performance. We have tested various SdA architectures with different configurations of hidden layer(s) and amount of pre-training data and compared the performance of deep networks relative to support vector machines (SVMs). Using the methylation states of sequentially neighboring regions as one of the learning features, an SdA achieved a blind test accuracy of 89.7\% for GM12878 and 88.6\% for K562. When the methylation states of sequentially neighboring regions are unknown, the accuracies are 84.82\% for GM12878 and 72.01\% for K562. We also analyzed the contribution of genome topological features inferred from Hi-C. DeepMethyl can be accessed at http://dna.cs.usm.edu/deepmethyl/.},

  abstract     = {After more than 70 years of evolution, great achievements have been made in machine translation. Especially in recent years, translation quality has been greatly improved with the emergence of neural machine translation (NMT). In this article, we first review the history of machine translation from rule-based machine translation to example-based machine translation and statistical machine translation. We then introduce NMT in more detail, including the basic framework and the current dominant framework, Transformer, as well as multilingual translation models to deal with the data sparseness problem. In addition, we introduce cutting-edge simultaneous translation methods that achieve a balance between translation quality and latency. We then describe various products and applications of machine translation. At the end of this article, we briefly discuss challenges and future research directions in this field.},

When only the sequence (profile) information is used as input feature, currently the best predictors can obtain \textasciitilde 80\% Q3 accuracy, which has not been improved in the past decade. Here we present DeepCNF (Deep Convolutional Neural Fields) for protein SS prediction. DeepCNF is a Deep Learning extension of Conditional Neural Fields (CNF), which is an integration of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and shallow neural networks. DeepCNF can model not only complex sequence-structure relationship by a deep hierarchical architecture, but also interdependency between adjacent SS labels, so it is much more powerful than CNF. Experimental results show that DeepCNF can obtain \textasciitilde 84\% Q3 accuracy, \textasciitilde 85\% SOV score, and \textasciitilde 72\% Q8 accuracy, respectively, on the CASP and CAMEO test proteins, greatly outperforming currently popular predictors. As a general framework, DeepCNF can be used to predict other protein structure properties such as contact number, disorder regions, and solvent accessibility.},

@article{wangProteinSequenceProtein2017,
  abstract     = {Sequence describes the primary structure of a protein, which contains important structural, characteristic, and genetic information and thereby motivates many sequence-based computational approaches to infer protein function. Among them, feature-base approaches attract increased attention because they make prediction from a set of transformed and more biologically meaningful sequence features. However, original features extracted from sequence are usually of high dimensionality and often compromised by irrelevant patterns, therefore dimension reduction is necessary prior to classification for efficient and effective protein function prediction. A protein usually performs several different functions within an organism, which makes protein function prediction a multi-label classification problem. In machine learning, multi-label classification deals with problems where each object may belong to more than one class. As a well-known feature reduction method, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) has been successfully applied in many practical applications. It, however, by nature is designed for single-label classification, in which each object can belong to exactly one class. Because directly applying LDA in multi-label classification causes ambiguity when computing scatters matrices, we apply a new Multi-label Linear Discriminant Analysis (MLDA) approach to address this problem and meanwhile preserve powerful classification capability inherited from classical LDA. We further extend MLDA by \$\textbackslash ell \_1\$ -normalization to overcome the problem of over-counting data points with multiple labels. In addition, we incorporate biological network data using Laplacian embedding into our method, and assess the reliability of predicted putative functions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate promising results of our methods.},

  abstract     = {Sequence alignment profiles have been shown to be very powerful in creating accurate sequence alignments. Profiles are often used to search a sequence database with a local alignment algorithm. More accurate and longer alignments have been obtained with profile-to-profile comparison. There are several steps that must be performed in creating profile–profile alignments, and each involves choices in parameters and algorithms. These steps include (1) what sequences to include in a multiple alignment used to build each profile, (2) how to weight similar sequences in the multiple alignment and how to determine amino acid frequencies from the weighted alignment, (3) how to score a column from one profile aligned to a column of the other profile, (4) how to score gaps in the profile–profile alignment, and (5) how to include structural information. Large-scale benchmarks consisting of pairs of homologous proteins with structurally determined sequence alignments are necessary for evaluating the efficacy of each scoring scheme. With such a benchmark, we have investigated the properties of profile–profile alignments and found that (1) with optimized gap penalties, most column–column scoring functions behave similarly to one another in alignment accuracy; (2) some functions, however, have much higher search sensitivity and specificity; (3) position-specific weighting schemes in determining amino acid counts in columns of multiple sequence alignments are better than sequence-specific schemes; (4) removing positions in the profile with gaps in the query sequence results in better alignments; and (5) adding predicted and known secondary structure information improves alignments.},

Although utilities exist for genome base polishing, they work best with high read coverage and do not scale well. We developed ntEdit, a Bloom filter-based genome sequence editing utility that scales to large mammalian and conifer genomes.We first tested ntEdit and the state-of-the-art assembly improvement tools GATK, Pilon and Racon on controlled Escherichia coli and Caenorhabditis elegans sequence data. Generally, ntEdit performs well at low sequence depths (\&lt;20×), fixing the majority (\&gt;97\%) of base substitutions and indels, and its performance is largely constant with increased coverage. In all experiments conducted using a single CPU, the ntEdit pipeline executed in \&lt;14\,s and \&lt;3\,m, on average, on E.coli and C.elegans, respectively. We performed similar benchmarks on a sub-20× coverage human genome sequence dataset, inspecting accuracy and resource usage in editing chromosomes 1 and 21, and whole genome. ntEdit scaled linearly, executing in 30–40\,m on those sequences. We show how ntEdit ran in \&lt;2 h 20 m to improve upon long and linked read human genome assemblies of NA12878, using high-coverage (54×) Illumina sequence data from the same individual, fixing frame shifts in coding sequences. We also generated 17-fold coverage spruce sequence data from haploid sequence sources (seed megagametophyte), and used it to edit our pseudo haploid assemblies of the 20 Gb interior and white spruce genomes in \&lt;4 and \&lt;5\,h, respectively, making roughly 50M edits at a (substitution+indel) rate of 0.0024.https://github.com/bcgsc/nteditSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract     = {Protein subcellular localization (PSL), as one of the most critical characteristics of human cells, plays an important role for understanding specific functions and biological processes in cells. Accurate prediction of protein subcellular localization is a fundamental and challenging problem, for which machine learning algorithms have been widely used. Traditionally, the performance of PSL prediction highly depends on handcrafted feature descriptors to represent proteins. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a hot research topic in the field of machine learning, achieving outstanding success in learning high-level latent features within data samples. In this paper, to accurately predict protein subcellular locations, we propose a deep learning based predictor called DeepPSL by using Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) networks. In this predictor, we automatically learn high-level and abstract feature representations of proteins by exploring non-linear relations among diverse subcellular locations, addressing the problem of the need of handcrafted feature representations. Experimental results evaluated with three-fold cross validation show that the proposed DeepPSL outperforms traditional machine learning based methods. It is expected that DeepPSL, as the first predictor in the field of PSL prediction, has great potential to be a powerful computational method complementary to existing tools.},

  abstract     = {Background: Given the demonstrated utility of Third Generation Sequencing [Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)] long reads in many studies, a comprehensive analysis and comparison of their data quality and applications is in high demand. Methods: Based on the transcriptome sequencing data from human embryonic stem cells, we analyzed multiple data features of PacBio and ONT, including error pattern, length, mappability and technical improvements over previous platforms. We also evaluated their application to transcriptome analyses, such as isoform identification and quantification and characterization of transcriptome complexity, by comparing the performance of size-selected PacBio, non-size-selected ONT and their corresponding Hybrid-Seq strategies (PacBio+Illumina and ONT+Illumina). Results: PacBio shows overall better data quality, while ONT provides a higher yield. As with data quality, PacBio performs marginally better than ONT in most aspects for both long reads only and Hybrid-Seq strategies in transcriptome analysis. In addition, Hybrid-Seq shows superior performance over long reads only in most transcriptome analyses. Conclusions: Both PacBio and ONT sequencing are suitable for full-length single-molecule transcriptome analysis. As this first use of ONT reads in a Hybrid-Seq analysis has shown, both PacBio and ONT can benefit from a combined Illumina strategy. The tools and analytical methods developed here provide a resource for future applications and evaluations of these rapidly-changing technologies.},

@article{wensingFifteenYearsHIV2010,
  abstract     = {HIV protease plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle and is essential for the generation of mature infectious virus particles. Detailed knowledge of the structure of HIV protease and its substrate has led to the design of specific HIV protease inhibitors. Unfortunately, resistance to all protease inhibitors (PIs) has been observed and the genetic basis of resistance has been well documented over the past 15 years. The arrival of the early PIs was a pivotal moment in the development of antiretroviral therapy. They made possible the dual class triple combination therapy that became known as HAART. However, the clinical utility of the first generation of PIs was limited by low bioavailability and high pill burdens, which ultimately reduced adherence and limited long-term viral inhibition. When therapy failure occurred multiple protease resistance mutations were observed, often resulting in broad class resistance. To combat PI-resistance development, second-generation approaches have been developed. The first advance was to increase the level of existing PIs in the plasma by boosting with ritonavir. The second was to develop novel PIs with high potency against the known PI-resistant HIV protease variants. Both approaches increased the number of protease mutations required for clinical resistance, thereby raising the genetic barrier. This review provides an overview of the history of protease inhibitor therapy, its current status and future perspectives. It forms part of a special issue of Antiviral Research marking the 25th anniversary of antiretroviral drug discovery and development, vol. 85, issue 1, 2010.},

HIV mutations conferring resistance to antiretroviral drugs reduce replicative fitness in vitro, but their effect on propagation in vivo is less understood. Here, we estimate transmission fitness of these mutations in antiretroviral-naïve populations in the U.S. National HIV Surveillance System by comparing their frequency of clustering in a genetic transmission network relative with wild-type viruses. The large dataset (66,221 persons), comprising 30,196 antiretroviral-naïve persons, permitted the evaluation of sixty-nine resistance mutations. Decreased transmission fitness was demonstrated for twenty-three mutations, including M184V. In contrast, many high prevalence mutations (e.g. K103N, Y181C, and L90M) had transmission fitness that was indistinguishable from or exceeded wild-type fitness, permitting the establishment of large, self-sustaining drug resistance reservoirs. We highlight implications of these findings on strategies to preserve global treatment effectiveness.},

Methods:~         We used sequence data from Variant, Atypical, and Resistant HIV Surveillance (VARHS) collected from newly diagnosed persons in 10 states and 1 county health department in 2006. To evaluate TDRM, we used a mutation list for surveillance of TDRM appropriate for the primarily subtype B HIV epidemic in the United States.         Results:~         Sequences were obtained from 2030 of 10 860 persons newly diagnosed with HIV in 11 surveillance areas. Mutations associated with transmitted drug resistance occurred in 292 (14.6\%) persons; TDRM associated with a specific drug class occurred in 156 (7.8\%) for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 111 (5.6\%) for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and 90 (4.5\%) for protease inhibitors. There were no significant differences in prevalence of TDRM by demographic characteristic. The HIV-1 subtype B was the most prevalent subtype occurring in 1922 (96.2\%) persons; subtype C (1.3\%) was the most prevalent non-B subtype.         Conclusion:~         We presented a clade B-optimized mutation list for evaluating surveillance of TDRM in the United States and analyzed the largest collection of sequence data obtained from individuals newly diagnosed with HIV. The prevalence of TDRM in persons newly diagnosed with HIV is higher than in previous U.S. studies; however, this is not necessarily a significant trend. Continued reporting of sequence data for public health purposes from all sources will improve representativeness and accuracy in analyzing trends in transmitted drug resistance and genetic diversity.},

  abstract     = {Phylogenetic inference from amino acid sequence data uses mainly empirical models of amino acid replacement and is therefore dependent on those models. Two of the more widely used models, the Dayhoff and JTT models, are estimated using similar methods that can utilize large numbers of sequences from many unrelated protein families but are somewhat unsatisfactory because they rely on assumptions that may lead to systematic error and discard a large amount of the information within the sequences. The alternative method of maximum-likelihood estimation may utilize the information in the sequence data more efficiently and suffers from no systematic error, but it has previously been applicable to relatively few sequences related by a single phylogenetic tree. Here, we combine the best attributes of these two methods using an approximate maximum-likelihood method. We implemented this approach to estimate a new model of amino acid replacement from a database of globular protein sequences comprising 3,905 amino acid sequences split into 182 protein families. While the new model has an overall structure similar to those of other commonly used models, there are significant differences. The new model outperforms the Dayhoff and JTT models with respect to maximum-likelihood values for a large majority of the protein families in our database. This suggests that it provides a better overall fit to the evolutionary process in globular proteins and may lead to more accurate phylogenetic tree estimates. Potentially, this matrix, and the methods used to generate it, may also be useful in other areas of research, such as biological sequence database searching, sequence alignment, and protein structure prediction, for which an accurate description of amino acid replacement is required.},

  abstract     = {Over the past several decades, atomistic simulations of biomolecules, whether carried out using molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo techniques, have provided detailed insights into their function. Comparing the results of such simulations for a few closely related systems has guided our understanding of the mechanisms by which changes such as ligand binding or mutation can alter the function. The general problem of detecting and interpreting such mechanisms from simulations of many related systems, however, remains a challenge. This problem is addressed here by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to a variety of thermodynamic observables extracted from molecular dynamics simulations of different systems. As an important test case, these methods are applied to understand the evasion by human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) protease of darunavir, a potent inhibitor to which resistance can develop via the simultaneous mutation of multiple amino acids. Complex mutational patterns have been observed among resistant strains, presenting a challenge to developing a mechanistic picture of resistance in the protease. In order to dissect these patterns and gain mechanistic insight into the role of specific mutations, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on a collection of HIV-1 protease variants, chosen to include highly resistant strains and susceptible controls, in complex with darunavir. Using a machine learning approach that takes advantage of the hierarchical nature in the relationships among the sequence, structure, and function, an integrative analysis of these trajectories reveals key details of the resistance mechanism, including changes in the protein structure, hydrogen bonding, and protein–ligand contacts.},

@article{wickPolypolishShortreadPolishing2022,
  abstract     = {Long-read-only bacterial genome assemblies usually contain residual errors, most commonly homopolymer-length errors. Short-read polishing tools can use short reads to fix these errors, but most rely on short-read alignment which is unreliable in repeat regions. Errors in such regions are therefore challenging to fix and often remain after short-read polishing. Here we introduce Polypolish, a new short-read polisher which uses all-per-read alignments to repair errors in repeat sequences that other polishers cannot. Polypolish performed well in benchmarking tests using both simulated and real reads, and it almost never introduced errors during polishing. The best results were achieved by using Polypolish in combination with other short-read polishers.},

@article{woodfordEmergenceAntibioticResistance2007,
  abstract     = {The emergence of mutations in nucleic acids is one of the major factors underlying evolution, providing the working material for natural selection. Most bacteria are haploid for the vast majority of their genes and, coupled with typically short generation times, this allows mutations to emerge and accumulate rapidly, and to effect significant phenotypic changes in what is perceived to be real-time. Not least among these phenotypic changes are those associated with antibiotic resistance. Mechanisms of horizontal gene spread among bacterial strains or species are often considered to be the main mediators of antibiotic resistance. However, mutational resistance has been invaluable in studies of bacterial genetics, and also has primary clinical importance in certain bacterial species, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori, or when considering resistance to particular antibiotics, especially to synthetic agents such as fluoroquinolones and oxazolidinones. In addition, mutation is essential for the continued evolution of acquired resistance genes and has, e.g., given rise to over 100 variants of the TEM family of β-lactamases. Hypermutator strains of bacteria, which have mutations in genes affecting DNA repair and replication fidelity, have elevated mutation rates. Mutational resistance emerges de novo more readily in these hypermutable strains, and they also provide a suitable host background for the evolution of acquired resistance genes in vitro. In the clinical setting, hypermutator strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, but a more general role for hypermutators in the emergence of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in a wider variety of bacterial pathogens has not yet been proven.},

The analysis supports the idea that diversification of HIV-1 in west-central Africa occurred long before the recognized AIDS pandemic.

@article{wrablGapsStructurallySimilar2004,
  abstract     = {An algorithm was developed to locally optimize gaps from the FSSP database. Over 2 million gaps were identified from all versus all FSSP structure comparisons, and datasets of non-identical gaps and flanking regions comprising between 90,000 and 135,000 sequence fragments were extracted for statistical analysis. Relative to background frequencies, gaps were enriched in residue types with small side chains and high turn propensity (D, G, N, P, S), and were depleted in residue types with hydrophobic side chains (C, F, I, L, V, W, Y). In contrast, regions flanking a gap exhibited opposite trends in amino acid frequencies, i.e., enrichment in hydrophobic residues and a high degree of secondary structure. Log-odds scores of residue type as a function of position in or around a gap were derived from the statistics. Three simple experiments demonstrated that these scores contained significant predictive information. First, regions where gaps were observed in single sequences taken from HOMSTRAD structure-based multiple sequence alignments generally scored higher than regions where gaps were not observed. Second, given the correct pairwise-aligned cores, the actual positions of gaps could be reproduced from sequence more accurately using the structurally-derived statistics than by using random pairwise alignments. Finally, revision of the Clustal-W residue-specific gap opening parameters with this new information improved the agreement of Clustal-W alignments with the structure-based alignments. At least three applications for these results are envisioned: improvement of gap penalties in pairwise (or multiple) sequence alignment, prediction of regions of single sequences likely (or unlikely) to contain indels, and more accurate placement of gaps in automated pairwise structure alignment.

It has also opened opportunities to improve the organization and accessibility of information acquired in sequencing projects.

Technological advancements in recent years have led to a situation in which digital cameras with high resolution are widely available. Consequently, traditional graphics recognition tasks may be updated to accommodate document images captured through a hand-held camera in an uncontrolled environment. In this paper the problem of perspective and geometric deformations correction in document images is discussed. The proposed approach uses the texture of a document image so as to infer the document structure distortion. A two-pass image warping algorithm is then used to correct the images. In addition to being language independent, the proposed approach may handle document images that include multiple fonts, math notations, and graphics. The de-warped images contain less distortions and so are better suited for existing text/graphics recognition techniques.},

  abstract      = {Transformer has become ubiquitous in natural language processing (e.g., machine translation, question answering); however, it requires enormous amount of computations to achieve high performance, which makes it not suitable for mobile applications that are tightly constrained by the hardware resources and battery. In this paper, we present an efficient mobile NLP architecture, Lite Transformer to facilitate deploying mobile NLP applications on edge devices. The key primitive is the Long-Short Range Attention (LSRA), where one group of heads specializes in the local context modeling (by convolution) while another group specializes in the long-distance relationship modeling (by attention). Such specialization brings consistent improvement over the vanilla transformer on three well-established language tasks: machine translation, abstractive summarization, and language modeling. Under constrained resources (500M/100M MACs), Lite Transformer outperforms transformer on WMT'14 English-French by 1.2/1.7 BLEU, respectively. Lite Transformer reduces the computation of transformer base model by 2.5x with 0.3 BLEU score degradation. Combining with pruning and quantization, we further compressed the model size of Lite Transformer by 18.2x. For language modeling, Lite Transformer achieves 1.8 lower perplexity than the transformer at around 500M MACs. Notably, Lite Transformer outperforms the AutoML-based Evolved Transformer by 0.5 higher BLEU for the mobile NLP setting without the costly architecture search that requires more than 250 GPU years.

The difficulty of this prediction task lies in the rarity of known drug-protein interactions and myriad unknown interactions to be predicted. To meet this challenge, a manifold regularization semi-supervised learning method is presented to tackle this issue by using labeled and unlabeled information which often generates better results than using the labeled data alone. Furthermore, our semi-supervised learning method integrates known drug-protein interaction network information as well as chemical structure and genomic sequence data.},

  abstract     = {Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nyströmformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nyström method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nyströmformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nyströmformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nyströmformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/mlpen/Nystromformer.},

They can affect the accumulation of the helper virus and alter the host symptoms induced by the helper virus. They include satellite viruses, satellite ribonucleic acids (RNAs) and satellite deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs). Size, genome structure and replication strategies vary greatly among plant virus satellites. Some plant virus satellites have been used as biocontrol reagents or as vectors to express exogenous genes. They have also been used as reporters for studying the evolutionary mechanisms of the helper virus. Key Concept: Plant virus satellites depend on a helper virus for replication, but they may use different host factors. Plant virus satellites do not provide any essential function for the helper virus. Plant virus satellites have varied effects on their helper viruses and hosts, including reduction in virus titer and exacerbation or attenuation of symptoms. Some plant satellite RNAs use ribozymes to resolve multimers generated during replication. Satellite DNAs are the symptom determinants in an increasing number of crop diseases caused by geminiviruses.},

Machine-learning approaches predict how sequence maps to function in a data-driven manner without requiring a detailed model of the underlying physics or biological pathways. Such methods accelerate directed evolution by learning from the properties of characterized variants and using that information to select sequences that are likely to exhibit improved properties.

This review covers basic concepts relevant to the use of machine learning for protein engineering, as well as the current literature and applications of this engineering paradigm. We illustrate the process with two case studies.

To realize the potential of this platform, a number of groups are developing bioinformatics tools tuned for the unique characteristics of its data. We note that these development efforts would benefit from a simulator software, the output of which could be used to benchmark analysis tools. ~Here, we introduce NanoSim, a fast and scalable read simulator that captures the technology-specific features of ONT data and allows for adjustments upon improvement of nanopore sequencing technology. The first step of NanoSim is read characterization, which provides a comprehensive alignment-based analysis and generates a set of read profiles serving as the input to the next step, the simulation stage. The simulation stage uses the model built in the previous step to produce in silico reads for a given reference genome. NanoSim is written in Python and R. The source files and manual are available at the Genome Sciences Centre website: http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/nanosim. In this work, we model the base-calling errors of ONT reads to inform the simulation of sequences with similar characteristics. We showcase the performance of NanoSim on publicly available datasets generated using the R7 and R7.3 chemistries and different sequencing kits and compare the resulting synthetic reads to those of other long-sequence simulators and experimental ONT reads. We expect NanoSim to have an enabling role in the field and benefit the development of scalable next-generation sequencing technologies for the long nanopore reads, including genome assembly, mutation detection, and even metagenomic analysis software.},

In prior work, we developed Accel-Align [1], a Seed-Embed-Extend (SEE) sequence aligner that uses randomized embedding algorithms to quickly identify optimal candidate locations using Hamming distance rather than edit distance. While Accel-Align provides up to an order of magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art aligners, the randomized nature of embedding can lead to alignment errors resulting in lower precision and recall with downstream variant callers. In this work, we propose several techniques for improving the accuracy of randomized embedding-based sequence alignment. We provide an efficient implementation of these techniques in Accel-Align, and use it to present a comparative evaluation that demonstrates that the accuracy improvements can be achieved without sacrificing performance.

  abstract     = {Highly active antiretroviral combination therapy (HAART) has been responsible for a dramatic decrease in AIDS mortality since 1996, and has changed the clinical profile of HIV infection from a sub-acute lethal to a chronic ambulatory disease. HAART consists of a double nucleoside (NRTI) backbone plus either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a ritonavir pharmacologically enhanced protease inhibitor (PI/r). Triple NRTI combinations are less potent than 2NRTIs/NNRTI or 2NRTIs/PI/r combinations. Antiretroviral first-line therapy is rapidly moving towards more convenient and less toxic regimens. Three double NRTI co-formulations are now available, and the risk of mitochondrial toxicity is low with drugs such as 3TC, FTC and tenofovir. Similarly, atazanavir, a recently available PI, can be given once daily and is less metabolically toxic than other PIs. Antiretroviral salvage therapy takes advantage of the development or availability of new drugs, either from existing (tipranavir, TMC 114 as new PIs) or new classes (T20 as a fusion inhibitor), that remain active on many triple-class drug resistant viruses. More progress is needed in the field of drug discovery, since a significant proportion of patients still die from AIDS with a multi-resistant virus, and since the incidence of primary HIV resistance is increasing in various parts of the world.},

In this review, we discuss the different assay methods, their findings on the mutation rates of HIV-1 and how the locations of mutations can be further analyzed for their allosteric effects to allow for new inhibitor designs.

Methods:~         All individuals resident in Geneva, Switzerland, with a newly diagnosed HIV infection between 2000 and 2008 were screened for HIV resistance. An infection was considered as recent when the positive test followed a negative screening test within less than 1 year. Phylogenetic analyses were performed by using the maximum likelihood method on pol sequences including 1058 individuals with chronic infection living in Geneva.         Results:~         Of 637 individuals with newly diagnosed HIV infection, 20\% had a recent infection. Mutations associated with resistance to at least one drug class were detected in 8.5\% [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 6.3\%; non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 3.5\%; protease inhibitors, 1.9\%]. TDR (P-trend = 0.015) and, in particular, NNRTI resistance (P = 0.002) increased from 2000 to 2008. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that 34.9\% of newly diagnosed individuals, and 52.7\% of those with recent infection were linked to transmission clusters. Clusters were more frequent in individuals with TDR than in those with sensitive strains (59.3 vs. 32.6\%, respectively; P {$<$} 0.0001). Moreover, 84\% of newly diagnosed individuals with TDR were part of clusters composed of only newly diagnosed individuals.         Conclusion:~         Reconstruction of the HIV transmission networks using phylogenetic analysis shows that newly diagnosed HIV infections are a significant source of onward transmission, particularly of resistant strains, thus suggesting an important self-fueling mechanism for TDR.},

  abstract     = {HIV-1 protease (PR) is an effective drug target for antiviral inhibitors. The conformational dynamics in the flaps of HIV-1 PR plays a crucial role in the mechanism of substrate binding. Here, the structural properties of the functionally important intermediate states of the flap opening transition of HIV-1 PR have been characterized by enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulation as well as long-time conventional non-enhanced simulations at atomic level. Not only crystallographically measured “closed” and “semi-open” structures but also a novel “curled” structure of HIV-1 PR is captured by both kinds of simulations qualitatively and quantitatively. The observation of the “curled” intermediate state helps to connect all other functionally important states to provide an integrated view of the transition pathway of the flap opening of HIV-1 PR (closed → curled → semi-open → fully open). The key residue–residue interactions which are broken or formed in the transition are analyzed to reveal the inherent driving force for the protein conformational transition.},

@inproceedings{zamaniAminoAcidEncoding2011,
  abstract   = {In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of a number of commonly used amino acid encodings by using artificial neural networks and substitution scoring matrices. An important step in many machine learning techniques applied in computational biology is encoding the symbolic data of protein sequences reasonably efficient in numeric vector representations. This encoding can be achieved by either considering the amino acid physicochemical properties or a generic numerical encoding. In order to be effective in the context of a machine learning system, an encoding must preserve information relative to the problem at hand, while diminishing superfluous data. To this end, it is important to measure how much an encoding scheme can conserve the underlying similarities and differences that exist among the amino acids. One way to evaluate the effectiveness of an amino acid encoding scheme is to compare it to the roles that amino acids are actually found to play in biological systems. A numerical representation of the similarities and differences between amino acids can be found in substitution matrices commonly used for sequence alignment, since these substitution matrices are based on measures of the interchangeability of amino acids in biological specimens. In this study, a new encoding scheme is also proposed based on the genetic codon coding occurs during protein synthesis. The experimental results indicate better performances compared to the other commonly used encodings.},

  abstract     = {Background: Resistance to antiretroviral drugs is a complex and evolving area with relevant implications in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Several rules, algorithms and full-fledged computer programs have been developed to assist the HIV specialist in the choice of the best patient-tailored therapy. Methods: Experts’ rules and statistical/machine learning algorithms for interpreting HIV drug resistance, along with their program implementations, were retrieved from PubMed and other on-line resources to be critically reviewed in terms of technical approach, performance, usability, update, and evolution (i.e. inclusion of novel drugs or expansion to other viral agents). Results: Several drug resistance prediction algorithms for the nucleotide/nucleoside/non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase inhibitors as well as coreceptor antagonists are currently available, routinely used, and have been validated thoroughly in independent studies. Computer tools that combine single-drug genotypic/phenotypic resistance interpretation and optimize combination antiretroviral therapy have been also developed and implemented as web applications. Most of the systems have been updated timely to incorporate new drugs and few have recently been expanded to meet a similar need in the Hepatitis C area. Prototype systems aiming at predicting virological response from both virus and patient indicators have been recently developed but they are not yet being routinely used. Conclusion: Computing HIV genotype to predict drug susceptibility in vitro or response to combination antiretroviral therapy in vivo is a continuous and productive research field, translating into successful treatment decision support tools, an essential component of the management of HIV patients.},

  abstract     = {For a long time, the clinical management of antiretroviral drug resistance was based on sequence analysis of the HIV genome followed by estimating drug susceptibility from the mutational pattern that was detected. The large number of anti-HIV drugs and HIV drug resistance mutations has prompted the development of computer-aided genotype interpretation systems, typically comprising rules handcrafted by experts via careful examination of in vitro and in vivo resistance data. More recently, machine learning approaches have been applied to establish data-driven engines able to indicate the most effective treatments for any patient and virus combination. Systems of this kind, currently including the Resistance Response Database Initiative and the EuResist engine, must learn from the large data sets of patient histories and can provide an objective and accurate estimate of the virological response to different antiretroviral regimens. The EuResist engine was developed by a European consortium of HIV and bioinformatics experts and compares favorably with the most commonly used genotype interpretation systems and HIV drug resistance experts. Next-generation treatment response prediction engines may valuably assist the HIV specialist in the challenging task of establishing effective regimens for patients harboring drug-resistant virus strains. The extensive collection and accurate processing of increasingly large patient data sets are eagerly awaited to further train and translate these systems from prototype engines into real-life treatment decision support tools.},

  abstract   = {Pairwise sequence alignment is one of the most computationally intensive kernels in genomic data analysis, accounting for more than 90\% of the runtime for key bioinformatics applications. This method is particularly expensive for third-generation sequences due to the high computational cost of analyzing sequences of length between 1Kb and 1Mb. Given the quadratic overhead of exact pairwise algorithms for long alignments, the community primarily relies on approximate algorithms that search only for high-quality alignments and stop early when one is not found. In this work, we present the first GPU optimization of the popular X-drop alignment algorithm, that we named LOGAN. Results show that our high-performance multi-GPU implementation achieves up to 181.6 GCUPS and speed-ups up to 6.6× and 30.7× using 1 and 6 NVIDIA Tesla V100, respectively, over the state-of-the-art software running on two IBM Power9 processors using 168 CPU threads, with equivalent accuracy. We also demonstrate a 2.3× LOGAN speed-up versus ksw2, a state-of-art vectorized algorithm for sequence alignment implemented in minimap2, a long-read mapping software. To highlight the impact of our work on a real-world application, we couple LOGAN with a many-to-many long-read alignment software called BELLA, and demonstrate that our implementation improves the overall BELLA runtime by up to 10.6×. Finally, we adapt the Roofline model for LOGAN and demonstrate that our implementation is near optimal on the NVIDIA Tesla V100s.},

Design and Methods:~         To assess the precision of the Antivirogram and PhenoSense assays, we examined susceptibility results of HIV-1 isolates lacking drug resistance mutations and containing matching patterns of drug resistance mutations. To assess sensitivity, we determined for each assay the proportion of isolates with common patterns of matching drug resistance mutations having reductions in susceptibility greater than those in isolates without drug resistance mutations.         Results:~         We analyzed protease inhibitor (PI) susceptibility results obtained by the Antivirogram assay for 293 isolates and by the PhenoSense assay for 300 isolates. We analyzed reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor susceptibility results obtained by the Antivirogram assay for 202 isolates and by the PhenoSense assay for 126 isolates. For wild-type and mutant isolates, the median absolute deviance of the fold resistance of nucleoside RT inhibitor susceptibility results was significantly lower for the PhenoSense assay than for the Antivirogram assay. The PhenoSense assay was also significantly more likely than the Antivirogram assay to detect resistance to abacavir, didanosine, and stavudine in isolates with the common drug resistance mutations M41L, M184V, and T215Y (±L210W). We found no significant differences between the 2 assays for detecting PI and nonnucleoside RT inhibitor resistance.         Conclusion:~         The PhenoSense assay is more precise than the Antivirogram assay and superior at detecting resistance to abacavir, didanosine, and stavudine.},

Its competitive performance in classification is surprising, because the conditional independence assumption on which it is based, is rarely true in realworld applications. An open question is: what is the true reason for the surprisingly good performance of naive Bayes in classification? In this paper, we propose a novel explanation on the superb classification performance of naive Bayes. We show that, essentially, the dependence distribution; i.e., how the local dependence of a node distributes in each class, evenly or unevenly, and how the local dependencies of all nodes work together, consistently (supporting a certain classification) or inconsistently (canceling each other out), plays a crucial role. Therefore, no matter how strong the dependences among attributes are, naive Bayes can still be optimal if the dependences distribute evenly in classes, or if the dependences cancel each other out. We propose and prove a sufficient and necessary conditions for the optimality of naive Bayes. Further, we investigate the optimality of naive Bayes under the Gaussian distribution. We present and prove a sufficient condition for the optimality of naive Bayes, in which the dependence between attributes do exist. This provides evidence that dependence among attributes may cancel out each other. In addition, we explore when naive Bayes works well.},

We have developed a series of single (non-consensus) methods (SPARKS, SP2, SP3, SP4) that are based on weighted matching of two to four sequence and structure-based profiles. There is a robust improvement of the accuracy and sensitivity of fold recognition as the number of matching profiles increases. Here, we introduce a new profile-profile comparison term based on real-value dihedral torsion angles. Together with updated real-value solvent accessibility profile and a new variable gap-penalty model based on fractional power of insertion/deletion profiles, the new method (SP5) leads to a robust improvement over previous SP method. There is a 2\% absolute increase (5\% relative improvement) in alignment accuracy over SP4 based on two independent benchmarks. Moreover, SP5 makes 7\% absolute increase (22\% relative improvement) in success rate of recognizing correct structural folds, and 32\% relative improvement in model accuracy of models within the same fold in Lindahl benchmark. In addition, modeling accuracy of top-1 ranked models is improved by 12\% over SP4 for the difficult targets in CASP 7 test set. These results highlight the importance of harnessing predicted structural properties in challenging remote-homolog recognition. The SP5 server is available at http://sparks.informatics.iupui.edu.},

It is parameterized by the k-mer length k, a window length w and an order on the k-mers. Minimizers are used in a large number of softwares and pipelines to improve computation efficiency and decrease memory usage. Despite the method’s popularity, many theoretical questions regarding its performance remain open. The core metric for measuring performance of a minimizer is the density, which measures the sparsity of sampled k-mers. The theoretical optimal density for a minimizer is 1/w, provably not achievable in general. For given k and w, little is known about asymptotically optimal minimizers, that is minimizers with density O(1/w).We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of asymptotically optimal minimizers. We also provide a randomized algorithm, called the Miniception, to design minimizers with the best theoretical guarantee to date on density in practical scenarios. Constructing and using the Miniception is as easy as constructing and using a random minimizer, which allows the design of efficient minimizers that scale to the values of k and w used in current bioinformatics software programs.Reference implementation of the Miniception and the codes for analysis can be found at https://github.com/kingsford-group/miniception.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here, the authors present a fast and controllable way to fabricate sub-5-nm nanopores on a graphene membrane, with a process including two steps: (i) sputtering a large nanopore using a conventional, focused ion beam; and (ii) shrinking the large nanopore to under 5\,nm using a scanning electron microscope. Conductance measurements confirm that the electron-beam-induced deposition of hydrocarbons not only shrinks the diameter of the nanopore but also increases its length. Furthermore, the authors report that using a salt gradient across the nanopore allows the detection of 3 nucleotide “C” and 3 nucleotide “G” homopolymer DNA strands based on differences in their physical dimensions.},

CRF19 was reported almost uniquely in Cuba, where it accounts for \textasciitilde 25\% of new HIV-positive patients and causes rapid progression to AIDS (\textasciitilde{} 3 years).{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}We analyzed a large data set comprising \textasciitilde{} 350 \emph{pol} and \emph{env} sequences sampled in Cuba over the last 15 years and \textasciitilde{} 350 from Los Alamos database. This data set contained both CRF19 (\textasciitilde{} 315), and A1, D and G sequences. We performed and combined analyses for the three A1, G and D regions, using fast maximum likelihood approaches, including: (1) phylogeny reconstruction, (2) spatio-temporal analysis of the virus spread, and ancestral character reconstruction for (3) transmission mode and (4) drug resistance mutations (DRMs). This allowed us to acquire new insights on the CRF19 origin and transmission patterns. We showed that CRF19 recombined between 1966 and 1977, most likely in Cuban community stationed in Congo region. We further investigated CRF19 spread on the Cuban province level, and discovered that the epidemic started in 1970\emph{s}, most probably in Villa Clara, that it was at first carried by heterosexual transmissions, and then quickly spread in the 1980\emph{s} within the “men having sex with men” (MSM) community, with multiple transmissions back to heterosexuals. The analysis of the transmission patterns of common DRMs showed mostly acquired drug resistance rather than transmitted one.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Our results show a very early introduction of CRF19 in Cuba, which could explain its local epidemiological success. Ignited by a major founder event, the epidemic then followed a similar pattern as other subtypes and CRFs in Cuba.

CRF19 is reported almost uniquely in Cuba, where it is highly prevalent (\textasciitilde{} 25\%) among newly detected HIV-1 patients. In this study, we found that CRF19 most likely recombined around the 1970\emph{s} in the Cuban community that was stationed in Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola at that time. It was introduced very early into the Cuban province of Villa Clara, from where it had several introductions to La Habana in the 1980\emph{s} and then further spread to other Cuban provinces. The CRF19 epidemic most probably started with heterosexual transmissions, followed in the 1980\emph{s} by multiple introductions into “men having sex with men” (MSM) community, followed by multiple transmissions back to heterosexuals (often females). The early introduction of CRF19 into Cuba most likely explains its success, not observed in other parts of the world. However, importantly, its rapid progression to AIDS makes it crucial to survey CRF19 sub-epidemics not only in Cuba, but also in other parts of the world having regular exchanges with Cuba.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract     = {Leptospira are emerging zoonotic pathogens transmitted from animals to humans typically through contaminated environmental sources of water and soil. Regulatory pathways of pathogenic Leptospira spp. underlying the adaptive response to different hosts and environmental conditions remains elusive. In this study, we provide the first global Transcriptional Start Site (TSS) map of a Leptospira species. RNA was obtained from the pathogen Leptospira interrogans grown at 30°C (optimal in vitro temperature) and 37°C (host temperature) and selectively enriched for 5' ends of native transcripts. A total of 2,865 and 2,866 primary TSS (pTSS) were predicted in the genome of L. interrogans at 30°C and 37°C, respectively. The majority of the pTSSs were located between 0 to 10 nucleotides from the translational start site, suggesting that leaderless transcripts are a common feature of the leptospiral translational landscape. Comparative differential RNA-sequencing (dRNA-seq) analysis revealed conservation of most pTSS at 30°C and 37°C. Promoter prediction algorithms allow the identification of the binding sites of the alternative sigma factor sigma 54. However, other motifs were not identified indicating that Leptospira consensus promoter sequences are inherently different from the E. coli model. RNA sequencing also identified 277 and 226 putative small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) at 30°C and 37°C, respectively, including 8 validated sRNAs by Northern blots. These results provide the first global view of transcriptional start sites and the repertoire of sRNAs in L. interrogans. These data will establish a foundation for future experimental work on gene regulation under various environmental conditions including those in the host.},

The guidelines have evolved rapidly reflecting the remarkable improvements in HIV therapeutics over this time. From guidelines based mostly on expert opinion – the current guidelines are now primarily evidence-based recommendations – which the vast majority of treating clinicians accept and follow. We will highlight the major guideline recommendations for initiation of antiretroviral therapy – focusing on new data for the asymptomatic patient and those presenting with acute AIDS-related opportunistic infections. Given the number of new drugs available, we are currently able to offer virtually all patients in practice – a fully suppressive regimen, even in patients with substantial multi-drug resistant HIV.

@article{zoritaStarcodeSequenceClustering2015,
  abstract     = {Motivation: The increasing throughput of sequencing technologies offers new applications and challenges for computational biology. In many of those applications, sequencing errors need to be corrected. This is particularly important when sequencing reads from an unknown reference such as random DNA barcodes. In this case, error correction can be done by performing a pairwise comparison of all the barcodes, which is a computationally complex problem.Results: Here, we address this challenge and describe an exact algorithm to determine which pairs of sequences lie within a given Levenshtein distance. For error correction or redundancy reduction purposes, matched pairs are then merged into clusters of similar sequences. The efficiency of starcode is attributable to the poucet search, a novel implementation of the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm performed on the nodes of a trie. On the task of matching random barcodes, starcode outperforms sequence clustering algorithms in both speed and precision.Availability and implementation: The C source code is available at http://github.com/gui11aume/starcode.Contact:guillaume.filion@gmail.com},

  abstract     = {The prediction of protein secondary structure (α-helices, β-sheets and coil) is improved by 9\% to 66\% using the information available from a family of homologous sequences. The approach is based both on averaging the Garnier et al. (1978) secondary structure propensities for aligned residues and on the observation that insertions and high sequence variability tend to occur in loop regions between secondary structures. Accordingly, an algorithm first aligns a family of sequences and a value for the extent of sequence conservation at each position is obtained. This value modifies a Gamier et al. prediction on the averaged sequence to yield the improved prediction. In addition, from the sequence conservation and the predicted secondary structure, many active site regions of enzymes can be located (26 out of 43) with limited over-prediction (8 extra). The entire algorithm is fully automatic and is applicable to all structural classes of globular proteins.},
