  abstract   = {Programs that monitor local, national, and regional levels of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance inform treatment guidelines and provide feedback on the success of HIV-1 treatment and prevention programs. To accurately compare transmitted drug resistance rates across geographic regions and times, the World Health Organization has recommended the adoption of a consensus genotypic definition of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance. In January 2007, we outlined criteria for developing a list of mutations for drug-resistance surveillance and compiled a list of 80 RT and protease mutations meeting these criteria (surveillance drug resistance mutations; SDRMs). Since January 2007, several new drugs have been approved and several new drug-resistance mutations have been identified. In this paper, we follow the same procedures described previously to develop an updated list of SDRMs that are likely to be useful for ongoing and future studies of transmitted drug resistance. The updated SDRM list has 93 mutations including 34 NRTI-resistance mutations at 15 RT positions, 19 NNRTI-resistance mutations at 10 RT positions, and 40 PI-resistance mutations at 18 protease positions.},

  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\textendash 156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

@article{brownReducedSusceptibilityHuman2000,
  abstract = {Recently, significant numbers of individuals with primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been found to harbor viral strains with reduced susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs. In one study, HIV from 16\% of such antiretroviral-naive individuals was shown to have a susceptibility to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NNRTIs) between 2.5- and 10-fold lower than that of a wild-type control. Mutations in the RT domain that had previously been associated with antiretroviral resistance were not shared by these strains. We have analyzed by logistic regression 46 variable amino acid sites in RT for their effect on susceptibility and have identified two novel sites influencing susceptibility to NNRTIs: amino acids 135 and 283 in RT. Eight different combinations of amino acids at these sites were observed among these patients. These combinations showed a 14-fold range in mean susceptibility to both nevirapine and delavirdine. In vitro mutagenesis of the control strain combined with a phenotypic assay confirmed the significance of amino acid variation at these sites for susceptibility to NNRTIs.},

@article{clarkReverseTranscriptaseMutations2006,
  abstract = {Background:~         HIV-1 hypersusceptibility to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) improves the response to NNRTI-containing regimens. The genetic basis for NNRTI hypersusceptibility was partly defined in our earlier analyses of a paired genotype\textendash phenotype dataset of viral isolates from treatment-experienced patients, in which we identified reverse transcriptase mutations V118I, H208Y, and T215Y as being strongly associated with NNRTI hypersusceptibility.         Objectives:~         We evaluated the role of these mutations in NNRTI hypersusceptibility by site-directed mutagenesis and phenotypic analysis of HIV-1 recombinants.         Methods:~         Drug susceptibility and replication capacity were determined in single cycle assays. Hypersusceptibility was defined by a statistically significant (P {$<$} 0.01; Student's t-test) mean fold-change in 50\% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of less than 0.4.         Results:~         The single mutations V118I, H208Y, and T215Y did not show hypersusceptibility to efavirenz with mean fold-change of 0.58, 0.55, and 0.70, respectively (P {$<$} 0.01 and P = 0.12). The H208Y/T215Y and V118I/H208Y/T215Y mutants showed marked hypersusceptibility to efavirenz, having mean fold-change values of 0.27 and 0.20, respectively (P {$<$} 0.001). In addition, H208Y/T215Y, V118I/T215Y, and V118I/H208Y/T215Y were hypersusceptible to delavirdine and nevirapine. The V118I/T215Y mutant was not replication impaired; whereas H208Y/T215Y and V118I/H208Y/T215Y had significantly (P {$<$} 0.01) reduced replication capacities of 40 and 35\% of wild-type, respectively.         Conclusion:~         Different combinations of V118I, H208Y, and T215Y produce NNRTI hypersusceptibility. The V118I/T215Y mutant is hypersusceptible to delavirdine and nevirapine without reduced replication capacity, whereas the H208Y/T215Y and V118I/H208Y/T215Y mutants are hypersusceptible to all NNRTI and show impaired replication. These findings suggest that more than one mechanism is involved in NNRTI hypersusceptibility.},

In the present study, we shall present a certain number of hybrid methods, conceived (or improved) by members of the SYMENU research group. These methods issue mainly from Machine Learning and from research on Classification Trees done in Statistics, and they may also be qualified as "rule-based".

@book{hastieElementsStatisticalLearning2009,
  abstract    = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

@article{hueDemonstrationSustainedDrugResistant2009,
  abstract  = {Transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance is well-recognized and compromises response to first-line therapy. However, the population dynamics of transmitted resistance remains unclear, although previous models have assumed that such transmission reflects direct infection from treated individuals. We investigated whether population-based phylogenetic analyses would uncover lineages of resistant viruses circulating in untreated individuals. Through the phylogenetic analysis of 14,061 HIV type 1 (HIV-1) pol gene sequences generated in the United Kingdom from both treatment-na\"ive and -experienced individuals, we identified five treatment-independent viral clusters containing mutations conferring cross-resistance to antiretroviral drugs prescribed today in the United Kingdom. These viral lineages represent sustainable reservoirs of resistance among new HIV infections, independent of treatment. Dated phylogenies reconstructed through Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo inference indicated that these reservoirs originated between 1997 and 2003 and have persisted in the HIV-infected population for up to 8 years. Since our cohort does not represent all infected individuals within the United Kingdom, our results are likely to underestimate the number and size of the resistant reservoirs circulating among drug-na\"ive patients. The existence of sustained reservoirs of resistance in the absence of treatment has the capacity to threaten the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral therapy and suggests there is a limit to the decline of transmitted drug resistance. Given the current decrease in resistance transmitted from treated individuals, a greater proportion of resistance is likely to come from drug-na\"ive lineages. These findings provide new insights for the planning and management of treatment programs in resource-rich and developing countries.},

  abstract   = {This mixed-methods study used qualitative interviews to explore discrepancies between self-reported HIV care and treatment-related behaviors and the presence of antiretroviral medications (ARVs) in a population-based survey in South Africa. ARV analytes were identified among 18\% of those reporting HIV-negative status and 18\% of those reporting not being on ART. Among participants reporting diagnosis over a year prior, 19\% reported multiple HIV tests in the past year. Qualitative results indicated that participant misunderstandings about their care and treatment played a substantial role in reporting inaccuracies. Participants conflated the term HIV test with CD4 and viral load testing, and confusion with terminology was compounded by recall difficulties. Data entry errors likely also played a role. Frequent discrepancies between biomarkers and self-reported data were more likely due to poor understanding of care and treatment and biomedical terminology than intentional misreporting. Results indicate a need for improving patient-provider communication, in addition to incorporating objective measures of treatment and care behaviors such as ARV analytes, to reduce inaccuracies.},

  abstract  = {Despite the high degree of HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) mutation in the setting of antiretroviral therapy, the spectrum of possible virus variants appears to be limited by patterns of amino acid covariation. We analyzed patterns of amino acid covariation in protease and RT sequences from more than 7,000 persons infected with HIV-1 subtype B viruses obtained from the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu). In addition, we examined the relationship between conditional probabilities associated with a pair of mutations and the order in which those mutations developed in viruses for which longitudinal sequence data were available. Patterns of RT covariation were dominated by the distinct clustering of Type I and Type II thymidine analog mutations and the Q151M-associated mutations. Patterns of protease covariation were dominated by the clustering of nelfinavir-associated mutations (D30N and N88D), two main groups of protease inhibitor (PI)\textendash resistance mutations associated either with V82A or L90M, and a tight cluster of mutations associated with decreased susceptibility to amprenavir and the most recently approved PI darunavir. Different patterns of covariation were frequently observed for different mutations at the same position including the RT mutations T69D versus T69N, L74V versus L74I, V75I versus V75M, T215F versus T215Y, and K219Q/E versus K219N/R, and the protease mutations M46I versus M46L, I54V versus I54M/L, and N88D versus N88S. Sequence data from persons with correlated mutations in whom earlier sequences were available confirmed that the conditional probabilities associated with correlated mutation pairs could be used to predict the order in which the mutations were likely to have developed. Whereas accessory nucleoside RT inhibitor\textendash resistance mutations nearly always follow primary nucleoside RT inhibitor\textendash resistance mutations, accessory PI-resistance mutations often preceded primary PI-resistance mutations.},

  abstract   = {An extended spectrum of HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase (RT) mutations in HAART-treated patients has been recently described. To verify the possible association of previously unreported RT mutations with a decrease of phenotypic susceptibility to nucleoside (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside (NNRTIs) RT inhibitors, the RT sequence of 328 HIV-1-positive patients (102 na\"ive and 226 treated with HAART participating in either the PhenGen or Genpherex study) was analyzed. All treated patients were tested at the time of therapeutic failure with both phenotypic (Antivirogram\textregistered, Virco) and genotypic analyses (VircoGen\texttrademark ); the frequency of RT substitutions (positions 1\textendash 240) with respect to consensus B was compared to that of na\"ive patients using a Chi-square test. Amino acid changes at 13 positions not included in the IAS list of resistance-associated mutations were detected more frequently in treated than in na\"ive subjects. The mutations involving 10 of these positions were associated with a reduced susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs; K20R, T39A, K43EQN, E203KD, H208Y, and D218E were correlated with NRTI resistance while mutations K101EQP, H221Y, K223EQ, L228HR were associated to NNRTI resistance. A correlation was found between K20R and lamivudine resistance (P = 0.006) while T39A (P = 0.005), K43EQN ({$<$}0.001), E203KD (P = 0.010), and H208Y (P = {$<$} 0.001) seemed to be associated with a previous use of zidovudine and stavudine and with the development of thymidine analog resistance. For H208Y, an association with use/resistance to abacavir (P = 0.004) was also noted. D218E showed a weak association to didanosine resistance (P = 0.013). The data confirm that previously unreported mutations are associated with antiretroviral drug experience and, more importantly, with a reduced susceptibility to NRTIs and NNRTIs. J. Med.

  abstract   = {The rapid replication of HIV-1 and the errors made during viral replication, cause the virus to evolve rapidly in patients, making the problems of vaccine development and drug therapy particularly challenging. In the absence of an effective vaccine, drugs are the only useful treatment. Anti-HIV drugs work; so far drug therapy has saved more than three million years of life. Unfortunately, HIV-1 develops resistance to all of the available drugs. Although a number of useful anti-HIV drugs have been approved for use in patients, the problems associated with drug toxicity and the development of resistance means that the search for new drugs is an ongoing process. The three viral enzymes, reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN), and protease (PR) are all good drug targets. Two distinct types of RT inhibitors, both of which block the polymerase activity of RT, have been approved to treat HIV-1 infections, nucleoside analogs (NRTIs) and nonnucleosides (NNRTIs), and there are promising leads for compounds that either block the RNase H activity or block the polymerase in other ways. A better understanding of the structure and function(s) of RT and of the mechanism(s) of inhibition can be used to generate better drugs; in particular drugs that are effective against the current drug-resistant strains of HIV-1.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

  abstract   = {In order to evaluate the usefulness of resistance testing after a viral rebound with plasma HIV RNA levels of less than 1,000 copies (c)/ml, genotyping was performed on 39 samples from patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) showing a viremia of over 50 c/ml up to a maximum of 1,000 c/ml after at least one undetectable viral load result. Protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences were obtained for all 39 samples. In 10 (25.6\%) of the samples, mutations not seen before the initiation of the regimen were observed. The M184V/I mutation was the most prevalent but in several patients a combination of multiple mutations was detected. Follow-up samples were available for 34 patients. In six (85.71\%) out of seven patients with new mutations, the viral load on the follow-up visit remained detectable, indicating true failure, compared to 6 (31.6\%) true failures out of 19 patients in whom only wild type virus was detected (P = 0.02) and three (37.5\%) out of eight patients in whom only the mutations already present at the initiation of HAART were seen (P = 0.08). The results indicate that reliable resistance testing can be performed on samples with a viral burden of less than 1,000 c/ml and demonstrate that multiple drug resistance mutations can be selected at low viral load rebounds. Most importantly, detection of resistance mutations in viral rebound samples was predictive of subsequent virological failure. J. Med.

  abstract = {Objective:~In resource-limited countries, antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been scaled up, but individual monitoring is still suboptimal. Here, we studied whether or not ART had an impact on the frequency and selection of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) under these settings. We also examined whether differences exist between HIV-1 genetic variants.         Design:~A total of 3736 sequences from individuals failing standard first-line ART (n = 1599, zidovudine/stavudine + lamivudine + neviparine/efavirenz) were analyzed and compared with sequences from reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI)-naive individuals (n = 2137) from 10 West and Central African countries.         Methods:~Fisher exact tests and corrections for multiple comparisons were used to assess the significance of associations.         Results:~All RTI-DRM from the 2015 International Antiviral Society list, except F227C, and nine mutations from other expert lists were observed to confer extensive resistance and cross-resistance. Five additional independently selected mutations (I94L, L109I, V111L, T139R and T165L) were statistically associated with treatment. The proportion of sequences with multiple mutations and the frequency of all thymidine analog mutations, M184V, certain NNRTIS, I94L and L109I showed substantial increase with time on ART. Only one nucleoside and two nonnucleoside RTI-DRMs differed by subtype/circulating recombinant form.         Conclusion:~This study validates the global robustness of the actual DRM repertoire, in particular for circulating recombinant form 02 predominating in West and Central Africa, despite our finding of five additional selected mutations. However, long-term ART without virological monitoring clearly leads to the accumulation of mutations and the emergence of additional variations, which limit drug options for treatment and can be transmitted. Improved monitoring and optimization of ART are necessary for the long-term effectiveness of ART.},

Nevertheless, a number of questions concerning their properties and inter-relationships remain unresolved. In this paper, we perform an organized study of information theoretic measures for clustering comparison, including several existing popular measures in the literature, as well as some newly proposed ones. We discuss and prove their important properties, such as the metric property and the normalization property. We then highlight to the clustering community the importance of correcting information theoretic measures for chance, especially when the data size is small compared to the number of clusters present therein. Of the available information theoretic based measures, we advocate the normalized information distance (NID) as a general measure of choice, for it possesses concurrently several important properties, such as being both a metric and a normalized measure, admitting an exact analytical adjusted-for-chance form, and using the nominal [0, 1] range better than other normalized variants.},

In practice, generalizability is frequently estimated by averaging the accuracies obtained on individual cross-validation folds. This procedure, however, is problematic in two ways. First, it does not allow for the derivation of meaningful confidence intervals. Second, it leads to an optimistic estimate when a biased classifier is tested on an imbalanced dataset. We show that both problems can be overcome by replacing the conventional point estimate of accuracy by an estimate of the posterior distribution of the balanced accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Estimating the true number of clusters in a data set is one of the major challenges in cluster analysis. Yet in certain domains,knowing the true number of clusters is of high importance. For example, in medical research, detecting the true number of groups and sub-groups of cancer would be of utmost importance for their effective treatment. In this paper we propose a novel method to estimate the number of clusters in a micro array data set based on the consensus clustering approach. Although the main objective of consensus clustering is to discover a robust and high quality cluster structure in a data set, closer inspection of the set of clusterings obtained can often give valuable information about the appropriate number of clusters present. More specifically, the set off clusterings obtained when the specified number of clusters coincides with the true number of clusters tends to be less diverse.To quantify this diversity we develop a novel index, namely the Consensus Index (CI), which is built upon a suitable clustering similarity measure such as the well known Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)or our recently developed, information theoretic based index, namely the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI). Our experiments on both synthetic and real microarray data sets indicate that the CI is a useful indicator for determining the appropriate number of clusters.},

@article{arayaSupportVectorMachine2009,
  abstract   = {The drug resistance of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is due to its fast and error-prone replication, is a key factor in the failure to combat the HIV epidemic. Performing pre-therapy drug resistance testing and administering appropriate drugs, or a combination of drugs, is therefore very useful. Genotyping tests HIV drug resistance by detecting specific mutations known to confer drug resistance. It is also cheaper than phenotypic testing and can be computerised, but it requires being able to know which mutations confer drug resistance. Previous research using pattern recognition techniques has been promising, but needs to be improved. It is also important that the techniques be highly adaptive when faced with new mutations or drugs. A relatively recent addition to pattern recognition techniques is the Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVMs have proved very successful in many benchmark applications such as face recognition and text recognition, and have also performed well in many computational biology problems. This paper explores the use of SVMs in predicting the drug resistance of an HIV strain extracted from a patient based on the genetic sequence of the viral DNA. We use as a case study that part of the HIV DNA that codes for the two enzymes, reverse transcriptase and protease, which are critical for the replication of the virus. To evaluate the performance of SVMs we used cross-validation to measure the unbiased estimate on 2045 data sets. The accuracy of classification and the area under the receiver operation characteristics (ROC) curve was used as a performance measure. We also developed other prediction models based on popular classification algorithms, namely neural networks, decision trees and logistic regression and these are explored in the paper. The results show that SVMs are a highly successful classifier and perform better than the other techniques with performance ranging between 94.1\% and 96.3\% accuracy and 81.3\% and 97.5\% area under the ROC curve.},

  abstract   = {Therapeutic success of anti-HIV therapies is limited by the development of drug resistant viruses. These genetic variants display complex mutational patterns in their pol gene, which codes for protease and reverse transcriptase, the molecular targets of current antiretroviral therapy. Genotypic resistance testing depends on the ability to interpret such sequence data, whereas phenotypic resistance testing directly measures relative in vitro susceptibility to a drug. From a set of 650 matched genotype\textendash phenotype pairs we construct regression models for the prediction of phenotypic drug resistance from genotypes. Since the range of resistance factors varies considerably between different drugs, two scoring functions are derived from different sets of predicted phenotypes. Firstly, we compare predicted values to those of samples derived from 178 treatment-naive patients and report the relative deviance. Secondly, estimation of the probability density of 2000 predicted phenotypes gives rise to an intrinsic definition of a susceptible and a resistant subpopulation. Thus, for a predicted phenotype, we calculate the probability of membership in the resistant subpopulation. Both scores provide standardized measures of resistance that can be calculated from the genotype and are comparable between drugs. The geno2pheno system makes these genotype interpretations available via the Internet (http://www.genafor.org/).},

@article{draghiciPredictingHIVDrug2003,
  abstract = {Motivation: Drug resistance is a very important factor influencing the failure of current HIV therapies.  The ability to predict the drug resistance of HIV protease mutants may be useful in developing more effective and longer lasting treatment regimens.Methods: The HIV resistance is predicted to two current protease inhibitors, Indinavir and Saquinavir. The problem was approached from two perspectives. First, a predictor was constructed based on the structural features of the HIV protease\textendash drug inhibitor complex. A particular structure was represented by its list of contacts between the inhibitor and the protease. Next, a classifier was constructed based on the sequence data of various drug resistant mutants. In both cases, self-organizing maps were first used to extract the important features and cluster the patterns in an unsupervised manner. This was followed by subsequent labelling based on the known patterns in the training set.Results: The prediction performance of the classifiers was measured by cross-validation. The classifier using the structure information correctly classified previously unseen mutants with an accuracy of between 60 and 70\%. Several architectures were tested on the more abundant sequence data. The best single classifier provided an accuracy of 68\% and a coverage of 69\%. Multiple networks were then combined into various majority voting schemes. The best combination yielded an average of 85\% coverage and 78\% accuracy on previously unseen data. This is more than two times better than the 33\% accuracy expected from a random classifier.Contact: sod@cs.wayne.edu*To whom correspondence should be addressed.},

@article{heiderMultilabelClassificationExploiting2013b,
  abstract = {Motivation: Antiretroviral treatment regimens can sufficiently suppress viral replication in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and prevent the progression of the disease. However, one of the factors contributing to the progression of the disease despite ongoing antiretroviral treatment is the emergence of drug resistance. The high mutation rate of HIV can lead to a fast adaptation of the virus under drug pressure, thus to failure of antiretroviral treatment due to the evolution of drug-resistant variants. Moreover, cross-resistance phenomena have been frequently found in HIV-1, leading to resistance not only against a drug from the current treatment, but also to other not yet applied drugs. Automatic classification and prediction of drug resistance is increasingly important in HIV research as well as in clinical settings, and to this end, machine learning techniques have been widely applied. Nevertheless, cross-resistance information was not taken explicitly into account, yet.Results: In our study, we demonstrated the use of cross-resistance information to predict drug resistance in HIV-1. We tested a set of more than 600 reverse transcriptase sequences and corresponding resistance information for six nucleoside analogues. Based on multilabel classification models and cross-resistance information, we were able to significantly improve overall prediction accuracy for all drugs, compared with single binary classifiers without any additional information. Moreover, we identified drug-specific patterns within the reverse transcriptase sequences that can be used to determine an optimal order of the classifiers within the classifier chains. These patterns are in good agreement with known resistance mutations and support the use of cross-resistance information in such prediction models.Contact:dominik.heider@uni-due.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Interpreting the results of plasma human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genotypic drug-resistance tests is one of the most difficult tasks facing clinicians caring for HIV-1\textemdash infected patients. There are many drug-resistance mutations, and they arise in complex patterns that cause varying levels of drug resistance. In addition, HIV-1 exists in vivo as a virus population containing many genomic variants. Genotypic-resistance testing detects the drug-resistance mutations present in the most common plasma virus variants but may not detect drug-resistance mutations present in minor virus variants. Therefore, interpretation systems are necessary to determine the phenotypic and clinical significance of drug-resistance mutations found in a patient's plasma virus population. We describe the scientific principles of HIV-1 genotypic-resistance test interpretation and the most commonly used Web-based resources for clinicians ordering genotypic drug-resistance tests.},

  abstract = {This review describes the state-of-the-art in statistical, machine learning, and expert-advised computational methods for the evaluation and optimization of combination antiretroviral therapy, with respect to the virologic outcomes in HIV-1-infected patients. Currently employed methodologies are based on the paradigm for which mutations present in patient viral genotypes, selected either by treatment or already transmitted to the patient as resistant mutants, are the major drivers of virologic outcomes. Genotypic interpretation systems have been designed with the prime objective of characterizing the resistance to individual drugs, deriving scores from the association of viral genotypes with in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility or in vivo response to treatment. Nevertheless, the very large range of possible drug combinations and of viral mutational patterns leads to an extremely complex scenario, making prediction of in vivo treatment response extremely challenging. To deal with such complexity, machine learning methods are being increasingly explored, thanks to the availability of exponentially growing HIV data bases in recent years. The combination of genotypic interpretation systems with other laboratory markers, treatment history, past clinical events, and the usage of data-driven techniques has dramatically raised the confidence in predicting virologic outcomes. A few of these systems have been implemented as free web-services, indicating ranks of suitable combination antiretroviral therapy regimens given a patient's clinical background. Future perspectives in the field foresee the extension of therapy optimization systems to newly approved antiretroviral drug targets and the prediction of other clinical outcomes, rather than the sole virologic response.},

However, the high mutation rate of HIV can lead to a fast adaptation of the virus under drug pressure and thereby to the evolution of resistant variants. In turn, these variants will lead to the failure of antiretroviral treatment. Moreover, these mutations cannot only lead to resistance against single drugs, but also to cross-resistance, i.e., resistance against drugs that have not yet been applied.},

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a powerful tool that would be able to assist in drug resistance prediction. In this study, we constrained the dataset to subtype B, sacrificing generalizability for a higher predictive performance, and demonstrated that the predictive quality of the ANN regression models have definite improvement for most ARVs.},

@article{steinerDrugResistancePrediction2020a,
  abstract  = {The fast replication rate and lack of repair mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) contribute to its high mutation frequency, with some mutations resulting in the evolution of resistance to antiretroviral therapies (ART). As such, studying HIV drug resistance allows for real-time evaluation of evolutionary mechanisms. Characterizing the biological process of drug resistance is also critically important for sustained effectiveness of ART. Investigating the link between \&ldquo;black box\&rdquo; deep learning methods applied to this problem and evolutionary principles governing drug resistance has been overlooked to date. Here, we utilized publicly available HIV-1 sequence data and drug resistance assay results for 18 ART drugs to evaluate the performance of three architectures (multilayer perceptron, bidirectional recurrent neural network, and convolutional neural network) for drug resistance prediction, jointly with biological analysis. We identified convolutional neural networks as the best performing architecture and displayed a correspondence between the importance of biologically relevant features in the classifier and overall performance. Our results suggest that the high classification performance of deep learning models is indeed dependent on drug resistance mutations (DRMs). These models heavily weighted several features that are not known DRM locations, indicating the utility of model interpretability to address causal relationships in viral genotype-phenotype data.},

@article{zhangComparisonPrecisionSensitivity2005a,
  abstract = {Objective:~         Although 2 widely used susceptibility assays have been developed, their precision and sensitivity have not been assessed.         Design and Methods:~         To assess the precision of the Antivirogram and PhenoSense assays, we examined susceptibility results of HIV-1 isolates lacking drug resistance mutations and containing matching patterns of drug resistance mutations. To assess sensitivity, we determined for each assay the proportion of isolates with common patterns of matching drug resistance mutations having reductions in susceptibility greater than those in isolates without drug resistance mutations.         Results:~         We analyzed protease inhibitor (PI) susceptibility results obtained by the Antivirogram assay for 293 isolates and by the PhenoSense assay for 300 isolates. We analyzed reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor susceptibility results obtained by the Antivirogram assay for 202 isolates and by the PhenoSense assay for 126 isolates. For wild-type and mutant isolates, the median absolute deviance of the fold resistance of nucleoside RT inhibitor susceptibility results was significantly lower for the PhenoSense assay than for the Antivirogram assay. The PhenoSense assay was also significantly more likely than the Antivirogram assay to detect resistance to abacavir, didanosine, and stavudine in isolates with the common drug resistance mutations M41L, M184V, and T215Y ({$\pm$}L210W). We found no significant differences between the 2 assays for detecting PI and nonnucleoside RT inhibitor resistance.         Conclusion:~         The PhenoSense assay is more precise than the Antivirogram assay and superior at detecting resistance to abacavir, didanosine, and stavudine.},
