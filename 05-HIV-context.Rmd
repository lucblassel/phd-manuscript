# HIV and DRMs

## What are viruses ?

-   Viruses are intracellular parasites [@minorViruses2014]

-   Weird in between, are they organisms or molecules ?

-   André Lwoff, famous Pasteur Virologist gave the most apt definition: *"viruses are viruses"* [@lwoffConceptVirus1957], there are however some key characteristics:

    -   They have some type of genetic information that is contained in some envelope

    -   They use the machinery of host cells to make copies of themselves

    -   can be pathogenic (HIV, SARS-CoV, Influenza, ...) or not (GBV-C [@stapletonGBVirusesReview2011] , a strain of H5N1 influenza [@yamamotoCharacterizationNonpathogenicH5N12011] )

-   All types of living organisms have their viruses:

    -   Animals:

        -   vertebrates [@shiEvolutionaryHistoryVertebrate2018]

        -   invertrebrates [@adamsAtlasInvertebrateViruses2017]

    -   Plants [@lefeuvreEvolutionEcologyPlant2019]

    -   Bacteria [@delbrockBacterialVirusesBacteriophages1946], phages being considered as therapy option separate to antibiotics [@clarkBacterialVirusesHuman2004; @vankan-davelaarUsingVirusesNanomedicines2014]

    -   Archea [@prangishviliVirusesArchaea2016; @prangishviliVirusesArchaeaUnifying2006]

    -   Virus of viruses like plant satellite viruses [@franckiPlantVirusSatellites; @xuPlantVirusSatellites2011] and hepatitis delta virus [@laiMolecularBiologyHepatitis1995; @hughesHepatitisDeltaVirus2011]. In both cases these "viroids" cannot replicate on theire own they must have a co-infection with the larger virus to replicate.

-   Where and when viruses originated is still under study [@nasirInvestigatingConceptOrigin2020; @forterreOriginViruses2009], but they may have played an important role in emergence of eukaryotic cells [@forterreOriginVirusesTheir2006].

-   In any case, because of co-evolution there is a strong link between virus and host genomes, and parts of the genome are probably ancient retroviral sequences [@boekeRetrotransposonsEndogenousRetroviruses1997; @kojimaViruslikeInsertionsSequence2021], it has been estimated that 1% to 8% of the human genome is composed of these endogenous retroviral sequences [@lowerVirusesAllUs1996; @griffithsEndogenousRetrovirusesHuman2001]

great diversity in viruses (support and replication strategy form the basis of the Baltimore virus classification system [@baltimoreExpressionAnimalVirus1971] , still used today [@kooninBaltimoreClassificationViruses2021] ):

-   Information support:

    -   DNA: Hepatitis B

        -   Double Stranded: like Herpesvirus [@mcgeochTopicsHerpesvirusGenomics2006; @boehmerHerpesVirusReplication2003]

        -   Single Stranded: Papillomavirus [@brentjensHumanPapillomavirusReview2002]

        -   circular DNA: Hepatitis B [@kayHepatitisVirusGenetic2007]

    -   RNA: HIV/SARS-CoV (about 70% of human pathogenic viruses are RNA viruses [@domingoRNAVirusGenomes2018]

        -   Single Stranded:

            -   positive strand: Hep C [@simmondsVariabilityHepatitisVirus1995] / polio [@wimmerGeneticsPoliovirus1993; @racanielloOneHundredYears2006]

            -   negative strand: Influenza, Measles [@paleseNegativestrandRNAViruses1996]

        -   Double stranded: Rotavirus [@parasharRotavirus1998]

-   Replication strategies [@domingoVirusEvolution2014]:

    -   RNA -\> RNA: SARS-CoV, Hep C, Dengue

    -   RNA -\> DNA -\> RNA: HIV-1

    -   DNA -\> DNA: Papillomavirus, Smallpox

    -   DNA -\> RNA -\> DNA: Hep B

-   size both physical and genomic:

    -   17nm for plant satellites [@pyleChapter58Biology2017] to Mimivirus a giant virus of 400nm [@raoult2megabaseGenomeSequence2004].

    -   860 bp for *Circovirus SFBeef* to 2.5 Mbp for *Pandoravirus salinus* [@campillo-balderasViralGenomeSize2015]

-   Shape of the virus :[@cannVirusStructure2015]

    -   Icosahedral: HIV

    -   helical: tobacco mosaic virus

    -   Head-tail: bacteriophages

## What is HIV ?

### Quick Presentation of HIV

Function / consequences:

-   Retrovirus that causes the AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) pandemic

-   Affects human immune system

-   Transmitted through sexual contact or through blood:

    -   Sexual activity is the largest case contributor [@hladikSettingStageHost2008; @shawHIVTransmission2012]:

        1.  Female genital tract (12.6 million)

        2.  Male genital tract (10.2 million)

        3.  Male/Female lower GI tract (3.9 million)

        4.  Blood stream (2.6 million)

-   It causes AIDS by penetrating CD4 cells of the host immune system, using them to replicate and destroying them in doing so [@weissHowDoesHIV1993]

-   the infection typically starts out with an asymptomatic phase that can last years, followed by a decrease in CDA cells that progresses to AIDS [@melhuishNaturalHistoryHIV2018]. When the CD4 cell count is low opportunistic diseases like tuberculosis, pneumonia or meningitis can more easily infect the host and lead to death.

History / pandemic:

-   Massive global pandemic, 2010 numbers [@worldhealthorganizationGlobalReportUNAIDS2010]:

    -   approx 33 million people were living with HIV, 2.6 million new infections in HIV and 1.8 millions AIDS deaths.

    -   This is decreasing with the 2020 numbers reporting 680,000 deaths and 1.5 million new infections [@GlobalHIVAIDS].

    -   70% of the new infections are from sub-saharan africa [@worldhealthorganizationGlobalReportUNAIDS2010]

-   Discovered simultaneously by Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, and Luc Montagnier and Robert Gallo in 1983 [@barre-sinoussiIsolationTlymphotropicRetrovirus1983; @galloIsolationHumanTcell1983]

-   VIH-1 vs VIH-2. VIH-1 is more transmissible and is largely responsible for the global pandemic [@gilbert2003], in fact in Africa HIV-1 infections are rising where HIV-2 are declining [@vanderloeffSixteenYearsHIV2006]

-   VIH-1 From Simian Immunodeficiency viruses most likely [@sharpOriginsHIVAIDS2011], probably from a chimpanzee [@gaoOriginHIV1Chimpanzee1999; @hamelTwentyYearsProspective2007].

-   VIH-2 also from a SIV probably from sooty mangabey [@hirschAfricanPrimateLentivirus1989; @gaoHumanInfectionGenetically1992; @chenGeneticCharacterizationNew1996]

-   There is not 1 lineage: Different groups (MNOP) correspond to distinct crossing over events (from chimp to human)

-   Group M is mostly responsible for the pandemic, estimated Last common ancestor of group M estimated between 1910 to 1931 [@korberTimingAncestorHIV12000; @worobeyDirectEvidenceExtensive2008; @rambautCausesConsequencesHIV2004], and probably originated in what is now the DRC [@worobeyDirectEvidenceExtensive2008; @vidalUnprecedentedDegreeHuman2000; @fariaEarlySpreadEpidemic2014].

-   In group M there are 9 subtypes (A to K) [@mccutchanGlobalEpidemiologyHIV2006; @sharpOriginsHIVAIDS2011]

-   There is recombination [@robertsonRecombinationAIDSViruses1995] which complicates phylogenetic analyses [@posadaRecombinationEvolutionaryGenomics2002], and are a pathway to resistance and complicate vaccine development [@taylorChallengeHIV1Subtype2008].

-   There are 118 identified HIV-1 CRFs currently in the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV sequence database [@HIVCirculatingRecombinant] (1 for HIV-2). There are also unique recombinant forms

-   While subtype C represented almost half of global infections from 2004 to 2007, subtype B is the major subtype in richer countries in North America and Western Europe [@hemelaarGlobalTrendsMolecular2011] where sequencing efforts are more common. This accounts for an over-representation of subtype B sequences in the LA database where 54% of sequences are of the B subtype and only 15% are C [@DistributionAllHIV1].

### Life cycle of HIV

-   Cycle [@freedHIV1Replication2001; @fergusonHIV1ReplicationCycle2002] shown in Figure \@ref(fig:hivCycle):
    1.  Virion attaches to CD4 host cell through membrane proteins

    2.  Membrane fusion and entry of viral material into cell

    3.  Reverse transcription of viral RNA into viral DNA (RT)

    4.  integration of viral DNA into host DNA (IN)

    5.  transcription of viral DNA into viral RNA

    6.  translation of viral RNA into polyprotein

    7.  cleaving of polyprotein to create mature viral proteins (PR)

    8.  assembly of viral RNA + mature viral proteins into new virion

    9.  Exit of new virion

### Genetics of HIV

-   9 genes:

    -   gag polyprotein: -\> structural proteins

        -   p17: mature protein matrix

        -   p24: capsid

        -   p7: nucleocapsid

        -   p6: promotes budding / virion release [@gottlingerEffectMutationsAffecting1991; @huangP6GagRequiredParticle1995]

    -   pol polyprotein: -\> functional proteins

        -   prot

        -   p51/p66 RT

        -   p32 int

    -   env polyprotein: -\> envelope

        -   gp 120: responsible for biding to CD4 cells [@bourHumanImmunodeficiencyVirus1995]

        -   gp 41: together with gp120 causes membrane fusion

    -   regulatory elements:

        -   tat (!!) activates transcription

        -   rev (!!) helps RNA get out of nucleus for translation

        -   nef (accs)

        -   vif (accs)

        -   vpu (accs)

    -   A 10th gene ?

        -   First suggested in 1988 [@millerHumanImmunodeficiencyVirus1988]

        -   overlaps env and is read in the reverse sense than the rest of the genome

        -   Under selective pressure and correlated with the spread of the pandemic (specific to HIV-M) [@cassanConcomitantEmergenceAntisense2016]

        -   under active research [@savoretPilotStudyHumoral2020]

### Main protein mechanisms in replication

-   RT

-   IN

-   PR

## Drug resistance in HIV

When on ART, virus evolves under selective pressure and develops resistance -\> treatment failure.

### What is ART ?

ART is very important in reducing the viral load and therefore reducing transmission [@eisingerHIVViralLoad2019], however it does not "cure" HIV, it controls it drastically reducing mortality and morbidity [@palellaDecliningMorbidityMortality1998].

Mostly target the RT and PR proteins

History [@zolopaEvolutionHIVTreatment2010; @forsytheTwentyYearsAntiretroviral2019]:

-   azidothymidine (AZT), an RTI, was shown to be effective against HIV in 1987 [@fischlEfficacyAzidothymidineAZT1987], only 3 years later resistant strains of the virus were circulating [@richmanSusceptibilityNucleosideAnalogues1990], because it was a monotherapy.

-   Between 1088 and 1995 four more RTIs were approved by the FDA and a combination therapy was shown to be effective [@gulickTreatmentIndinavirZidovudine1997]

-   In 2008 there were 30 antiretroviral drugs have approved by the FDA [@palmisanoBriefHistoryAntiretroviral2011], of which 12 were RTI, 10 PIs and 5 combination drugs, often available as a single pill.

-   In 2019 there are 11 licensed single pill regimens in Europe [@OnepilladayHIVTreatments].

Other drugs:

-   entry inhibitors: have been shown to be effective 2 have been approved in the USA [@tiltonEntryInhibitorsTreatment2010]

-   integrase inhibitors (INI): recent focus on development, 5 approved drugs since 2007 [@scarsiHIV1IntegraseInhibitors2020]

-   Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), putting uninfected but at risk populations on ART before any known exposure. Has been shown effectively lower risk of infection in several studies [@grantPreexposureChemoprophylaxisHIV2010; @baetenAntiretroviralProphylaxisHIV2012; @buchbinderPreexposureProphylaxisPromise2011]. When adherence is maintained studies have shown a infection risk between 44% and 100% [@riddellHIVPreexposureProphylaxis2018].\
    In 2022 there are 1 PrEP regimen approved for use in Europe [@emaTruvada2018].

-   Action of ART drugs:

    -   RTI:

        -   NRTI: nucleoside analogue RTI work by binding with the active site of RT blocking DNA polymerization -\> chain terminating inhibitors

        -   NNRTI: non-nucleoside analogue RTI, bind to other a hydrophobic pocket behind the active site the RT, changing its flexibility and rendering it incative [@esnoufUniqueFeaturesStructure1997]

    -   PI: bind to active site of protease to hinder action [@robertsRationalDesignPeptideBased1990]

    -   Entry inhibitors are being found [@esteHIVEntryInhibitors2007; @kilbyNovelTherapiesBased2003]. enfuvirtide binds to gp41 and prevents fusion [@fletcherEnfuvirtideNewDrug2003]

    -   INI: prevent strand transfer where viral DNA is first linked to host DNA [@pommierIntegraseInhibitorsTreat2005]

However Drug resistance has emerged for most treatment types even PrEP [@knoxMultidrugResistantHIV1Infection2017; @hurtPreexposureProphylaxisAntiretroviral2011] but seem to be rare and due to pre-treatment but unknown HIV infection [@gibasDrugResistanceHIV2019]

### How can HIV evade ART ?

review [@ammaranondMechanismHIVAntiretroviral2012; @clavelHIVDrugResistance2004]

-   NRTI [@menendez-ariasMechanismsResistanceNucleoside2008; @sluis-cremerMolecularMechanismsHIV12000]:
    -   Prevent incorporation of NRTI, like M184V [@sarafianosLamivudine3TCResistance1999]

    -   Remove incorporated NRTI: TAMs [@meyerMechanismAZTResistance1999; @boyerSelectiveExcisionAZTMP2001]
-   NNRTI: mutations limiting access to the binding pocket like Y181C or changing the shape of it like K103N [@deeksNonnucleosideReverseTranscriptase2001]. dangerous because a single mutation produces viruses that are both fit and highly resistant [@ammaranondMechanismHIVAntiretroviral2012] + cross-resistance
-   PI: make active site bigger reducing affinity to inhibitors but also to natural substrate [@wensingFifteenYearsHIV2010]
-   INI: reduce affinity to inhibitors [@blancoHIV1IntegraseInhibitor2011]

### Consequences on global health

-   Transmission of drug resistant viruses, particularly between treatment-naive individuals which is the main transmission mode in the UK [@mouradPhylotypebasedAnalysisHighlights2015] and Switzerland [@drescherTreatmentNaiveIndividualsAre2014], creating long lasting drug resistance reservoirs in naive population.

-   Dangerous because there can be therapeutic failure of first line regimen.

-   Fitness is lower for some DRMs [@kuhnertQuantifyingFitnessCost2018; @mespledeViralFitnessCost2013] which means there is evolutionary pressure for these mutations to disappear in the absence of treatment

-   the reversion to WT can last a long time with a wide range of median loss times from 1 to 13 years [@castroPersistenceHIV1Transmitted2013], depending on the type of mutation (NRTI \> NNRTI).

### Finding DRMS

(This sections build upon a review we did [@blasselDrugResistanceMutations2021]

-   Finding and categorizing DRMs is an important task.
-   Sequence databases useful in discovery:
    -   UK-CHIC [@ukchicsteeringcommitteeCreationLargeUKbased2004] and the uk HIV drug resistance database (<https://www.hivrdb.org.uk/>)

    -   Swiss cohort study (<https://www.shcs.ch/>)

    -   PANGEA [@abeler-dornerPANGEAHIVPhylogeneticsNetworks2019]

    -   Standford HIV Drug resistance database (<https://hivdb.stanford.edu/>) with sequences [@rheeHumanImmunodeficiencyVirus2003]
-   Databases of mutations are kept [@shaferRationaleUsesPublic2006] with regularly update lists of important DRMs [@wensing2019UpdateDrug2019; @clarkMutationsRetroviralGenes2007] and tools to help practitioners detect and interpret resistance [@liuWebResourcesHIV2006d].
-   stat tests
    -   multiple testing
    -   phylogenetic correlation
-   assays
-   novel approaches
    -   deep learning
    -   ...
